# Google Books Extractor

Obtain information about books via the Google Books API using a variety of search term combinations and filters.

## What it does

The application uses the Google Books API to extract book details such as title, authors, and description, and write these into a CSV file for further processing, for instance by text mining tools.

Search term combinations and regex-type filters are specified in an XML file that can be edited using any standard editor. There are three different ways in which search terms can be specified:
* Single search term
* Multiple search terms
* Binomial combinations of search terms

The application can be run on Eclipse or using the executable jar and helper files provided as a zipped archive in the release section.
