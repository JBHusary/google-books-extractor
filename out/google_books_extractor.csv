"Market Discipline Under Systemic Risk. Evidence from Bank Runs in Emerging Economies","[Eduardo Levy Yeyati, Maria Soledad Martinez Peria, Sergio L. Schmukler]","[Capital market]","""Levy-Yeyati, Martinez Peria, and Schmukler show that systemic risk exerts a significant impact on the behavior of depositors, sometimes overshadowing their responses to standard bank fundamentals. Systemic risk can affect market discipline both regardless of and through bank fundamentals. First, worsening systemic conditions can directly threaten the value of deposits by way of dual agency problems. Second, to the extent that banks are exposed to systemic risk, systemic shocks lead to a future deterioration of fundamentals not captured by their current values. Using data from the recent banking crises in Argentina and Uruguay, the authors show that market discipline is indeed quite robust once systemic risk is factored in. As systemic risk increases, the informational content of past fundamentals declines. These episodes also show how few systemic shocks can trigger a run irrespective of ex-ante fundamentals. Overall, the evidence suggests that in emerging economies, the notion of market discipline needs to account for systemic risk. This paper--a product of the Finance Team, Development Research Group--is part of a larger effort in the group to study market discipline""--World Bank web site.","2004","http://books.google.es/books?id=Cx8z4mvVHYYC&printsec=frontcover&dq=intitle:market%2Bintitle:systemic%2Bintitle:risk&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api","Market Discipline U",
"Global Market Conditions and Systemic Risk (EPub)","[Heiko Hesse, Brenda González-Hermosillo]",,"This paper examines several key global market conditions, such as a proxy for market uncertainty and measures of interbank funding stress, to assess financial volatility and the likelihood of crisis. Using Markov regime-switching techniques, it shows that the Lehman Brothers failure was a watershed event in the crisis, although signs of heightened systemic risk could be detected as early as February 2007. In addition, we analyze the role of global market conditions to help determine when governments should begin to exit their extraordinary public support measures.","2009-10-01","http://books.google.es/books?id=GoRRw8G1AAYC&printsec=frontcover&dq=intitle:market%2Bintitle:systemic%2Bintitle:risk&hl=&cd=2&source=gbs_api","1452786380",
"Collateral, Netting and Systemic Risk in the OTC Derivatives Market (EPub)","[Manmohan Singh]",,"To mitigate systemic risk, some regulators have advocated the greater use of centralized counterparties (CCPs) to clear Over-The-Counter (OTC) derivatives trades. Regulators should be cognizant that large banks active in the OTC derivatives market do not hold collateral against all the positions in their trading book and the paper proves an estimate of this under-collateralization. Whatever collateral is held by banks is allowed to be rehypothecated (or re-used) to others. Since CCPs would require all positions to have collateral against them, off-loading a significant portion of OTC derivatives transactions to central counterparties (CCPs) would require large increases in posted collateral, possibly requiring large banks to raise more capital. These costs suggest that most large banks will be reluctant to offload their positions to CCPs, and the paper proposes an appropriate capital levy on remaining positions to encourage the transition.","2010-04-01","http://books.google.es/books?id=JIpd5zMZ__EC&printsec=frontcover&dq=intitle:market%2Bintitle:systemic%2Bintitle:risk&hl=&cd=3&source=gbs_api","1452756090",

"Statistical Learning of Gene Annotations in Saccharomyces Cerevisiae [microform]","[Trochesset, Miles]",,"We present machine learning algorithms for predicting the biological functions of genes. Determining function is simplified to a series of binary classifications. The main challenge of this learning task lies in the extremely small number of positives, compared with large amounts of negatives. We develop a method based on hierarchical clustering with labeled data to search for regions of high positive concentrations. We investigate logistic regression as a baseline for comparing to our technique. These methods are based on different views of the data and depending on the biological processes, one or the other of these approaches performs better, although our method makes more confident predictions for more biological processes. We also investigate data-preprocessing methods, and develop two algorithms for filling missing values in the datasets, which is necessary before some statistical methods can be used.","2004","http://books.google.es/books?id=CMl3tgAACAAJ&dq=intitle:%22statistical+learning+of%22&hl=&cd=3&source=gbs_api","0612952800",

These are evaluated using two statistical classifiers applied to large document collections from practical databases, the Reuters reference corpus and the OHSUMED heart-disease corpus. We find that the simplest method, document frequency thresholding, out performs [sic] more sophisticated methods, including mutual information and chi-squared term-category correlation criteria and document-cluster analysis. Principal component analysis can have a strong impact on both the effectiveness and efficiency of learning methods based on linear regression. Combining the frequency-threshold-based feature selection method and principal component analysis as input to a linear least-squares categorizer we achieve a level of precision that significantly out performs [sic] published results on the same collections.""","1996","http://books.google.es/books?id=dffaHAAACAAJ&dq=intitle:%22statistical+learning+of%22&hl=&cd=5&source=gbs_api","OCLC:38889663",

"Simulation and Design of an Automatic Controller for a Fast Breeder Nuclear Reactor Power Plant","[Siegfried Netzband]",,"The dynamic equations for a Liquid Metal Fast Breeder Nuclear Reactor (LMFBR) Power Plant are derived. These nonlinear differential equations with typical design values for the system parameters are solved on a COMCOR Ci 5000 analog computer for the characteristic transients of the basic plant and the results compared with a recently proposed LMFBR design. A digital computer automatic control program is developed which uses, in addition to the ideas of derivative and proportional control, precomputed control trajectories. The digital controller design is implemented by applying FORTRAN IV programming to the XDS 9300 digital computer. The effectiveness of the strategy for the automatic controller is demonstrated by using various step changes in the load demand. A special software routine was written to automatically scale the analog computer and proved to be quite useful in improving the operating efficiency of the hybrid computer simulation.

However, it is not clear whether or not DBS works via the same mechanisms as those induced by antidepressant medications. Processes currently implicated in antidepressant effects include neuroplastic changes and promotion of neurogenesis. We investigated the effects of chronic treatment with three different classes of antidepressants and DBS on markers of neuroplasticity (brain-derived neurotrophic factor, (BDNF), and phosphorylated cyclic-AMP regulatory element binding protein, (pCREB)) and neurogenesis (Ki-67, bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) and doublecortin) in the rat hippocampus. No clear treatment effects were seen on BDNF, pCREB and Ki-67 levels. However all treatments caused increased levels of BrdU (range: 46%-96%) and doublecortin (8%-61%), although these effects were statistically significant only for DBS and amitriptyline, respectively. This overall pattern of results may suggest that diverse antidepressant treatments could possibly share common mechanisms involving cell survival and neuronal differentiation. Potentiated effects of DBS on cell survival may underlie its efficacy in treatment-resistant depression.","2011","http://books.google.es/books?id=Mnw6MwEACAAJ&dq=intitle:neuroplasticity%2Bintitle:brain&hl=&cd=8&source=gbs_api","0494761806",
