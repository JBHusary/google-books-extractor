"Global Market Conditions and Systemic Risk","market+systemic","[Brenda Gonzlez-Hermosillo, Heiko Hesse, Gonz&#x00E1, lez-Hermosillo, Brenda]","[Business & Economics]","This paper examines several key global market conditions, such as a proxy for market uncertainty and measures of interbank funding stress, to assess financial volatility and the likelihood of crisis. Using Markov regime-switching techniques, it shows that the Lehman Brothers failure was a watershed event in the crisis, although signs of heightened systemic risk could be detected as early as February 2007. In addition, we analyze the role of global market conditions to help determine when governments should begin to exit their extraordinary public support measures.","2009-10-01","http://books.google.es/books?id=tJg54uDm4YMC&printsec=frontcover&dq=market%2Bsystemic&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api","9781451917956",
"Market Discipline Under Systemic Risk. Evidence from Bank Runs in Emerging Economies","market+systemic","[Eduardo Levy Yeyati, Maria Soledad Martinez Peria, Sergio L. Schmukler]","[Bank failures]","""Levy-Yeyati, Martinez Peria, and Schmukler show that systemic risk exerts a significant impact on the behavior of depositors, sometimes overshadowing their responses to standard bank fundamentals. Systemic risk can affect market discipline both regardless of and through bank fundamentals. First, worsening systemic conditions can directly threaten the value of deposits by way of dual agency problems. Second, to the extent that banks are exposed to systemic risk, systemic shocks lead to a future deterioration of fundamentals not captured by their current values. Using data from the recent banking crises in Argentina and Uruguay, the authors show that market discipline is indeed quite robust once systemic risk is factored in. As systemic risk increases, the informational content of past fundamentals declines. These episodes also show how few systemic shocks can trigger a run irrespective of ex-ante fundamentals. Overall, the evidence suggests that in emerging economies, the notion of market discipline needs to account for systemic risk. This paper--a product of the Finance Team, Development Research Group--is part of a larger effort in the group to study market discipline""--World Bank web site.","2004","http://books.google.es/books?id=Cx8z4mvVHYYC&printsec=frontcover&dq=market%2Bsystemic&hl=&cd=2&source=gbs_api","Market Discipline U",
"Market-Based Policy Instruments for Systemic Bank Restructuring","market+systemic","[Tamim Bayoumi, Paul R. Masson]","[Business & Economics]","Since the early 1980s, well over 100 countries have experienced systemic bank insolvencies. An important innovation among the resulting policies for reestablishing bank soundness has been the reliance on market-based instruments and policies, in contrast to the largely non-market-oriented approach taken in the 1930s during the last big wave of banking crises. This paper surveys and assesses market-based policy instruments employed to overcome systemic bank problems. Considerations regarding the design and mix of instruments as well as cost-sharing arrangements are shown to be key aspects of effective bank restructuring. Selected country examples are used to illustrate best practices.","1998-08-01","http://books.google.es/books?id=5W5AUzasmIwC&printsec=frontcover&dq=market%2Bsystemic&hl=&cd=3&source=gbs_api","9781451899085",

Current macroprudential policy and surveillance (MPS) efforts are aimed establishing a regulatory framework that helps mitigate the risk from systemic linkages with a view towards enhancing the resilience of the financial sector. This paper presents a forward-looking framework (""Systemic CCA"") to measure systemic solvency risk based on market-implied expected losses of financial institutions with practical applications for the financial sector risk management and the system-wide capital assessment in top-down stress testing. The suggested approach uses advanced contingent claims analysis (CCA) to generate aggregate estimates of the joint default risk of multiple institutions as a conditional tail expectation using multivariate extreme value theory (EVT). In addition, the framework also helps quantify the individual contributions to systemic risk and contingent liabilities of the financial sector during times of stress.","2013-02-27","http://books.google.es/books?id=ZoS2W2UXscMC&pg=PA2&dq=market%2Bsystemic&hl=&cd=6&source=gbs_api","1557755019",

"Collateral, Netting and Systemic Risk in the Otc Derivatives Market","market+systemic","[Manmohan Singh]","[Business & Economics]","To mitigate systemic risk, some regulators have advocated the greater use of centralized counterparties (CCPs) to clear Over-The-Counter (OTC) derivatives trades. Regulators should be cognizant that large banks active in the OTC derivatives market do not hold collateral against all the positions in their trading book and the paper proves an estimate of this under-collateralization. Whatever collateral is held by banks is allowed to be rehypothecated (or re-used) to others. Since CCPs would require all positions to have collateral against them, off-loading a significant portion of OTC derivatives transactions to central counterparties (CCPs) would require large increases in posted collateral, possibly requiring large banks to raise more capital. These costs suggest that most large banks will be reluctant to offload their positions to CCPs, and the paper proposes an appropriate capital levy on remaining positions to encourage the transition.","2010-04-01","http://books.google.es/books?id=10JrdHH3XBAC&printsec=frontcover&dq=market%2Bsystemic&hl=&cd=9&source=gbs_api","9781451982855",

"The Systemic Regulation of Credit Rating Agencies and Rated Markets (EPub)","market+systemic","[Mr. Amadou N. R.

Proposals to regulate credit rating agencies focus on micro-prudential issues and aim at reducing conflicts of interest and increasing transparency and competition. In contrast, this paper argues that macro-prudential regulation is necessary to address the systemic risk inherent to ratings. The paper illustrates how financial markets have increasingly relied on ratings. It shows how downgrades have led to systemic market losses and increased illiquidity. The paper suggests the use of ""ratings maps"" and stress-tests to assess the systemic risk of ratings, and increased capital or liquidity buffers to manage such risk.","2009-06-01","http://books.google.es/books?id=oeyKx-WgbvQC&pg=RA1-PR20&dq=market%2Bsystemic&hl=&cd=12&source=gbs_api","9781452765204",

In the case of the Federal Crop Insurance program, rates are set non-competitively. This study develops a spatial econometric model of loss experience and finds evidence of geographic misratings. The results also suggest that substantial actuarial cross-subsidization is resulting from the apparent rating inequities, which has a variety of welfare implications.","2008","http://books.google.es/books?id=Z8RtXAt5Y24C&pg=PA24&dq=market%2Bsystemic&hl=&cd=17&source=gbs_api","0549911456",

"Reforming the International Financial System for Development","market+systemic","[Jomo Kwame Sundaram]","[Business & Economics]","The 1944 Bretton Woods conference created new institutions for international economic governance. Though flawed, the system led to, a golden age in postwar reconstruction, sustained economic growth, job creation, and postcolonial development. Yet financial liberalization since the 1970s has involved deregulation and globalization, which have exacerbated instability, rather than sustained growth. In addition, the failure of Bretton Woods to provide a reserve currency enabled the dollar to fill the void, which has contributed to periodic, massive U.S. trade deficits. Our latest global financial crisis, in which all these weaknesses played a part, underscores how urgently we must reform the international financial system. Prepared for the G24, a consortium of developing countries focused on financial issues, this volume sues that such reforms must be developmental. Chapters review historical trends in global liquidity, financial flows to emerging markets, and the food crisis, identifying the systemic flaws that contributed to the recent downturn. They challenge the effectiveness of recent policy .and suggest criteria for regulatory reform, keeping in mind the different circumstances, capacities, and capabilities of various economies. Essays follow ongoing revisions in international banking standards, the improved management of international capital flows, the critical role of the World Trade Organization in liberalizing and globalizing financial services, and the need for international tax cooperation. They also propose new global banking and reserve currency arrangements. Jomo Kwame Sundaram is assistant secretary general for economic development at the United Nations and research coordinator for the G24 Intergovernmental Group on International Monetary Affairs and Development.

"Financial Market Regulation and Reforms in Emerging Markets","market+systemic","[Masahiro Kawai]","[Business & Economics]","The global financial crisis that began in 2008 highlighted the need for strengthening financial systems in emerging markets and in low-income developing economies. The contributors to this volume outline these and other pressing issues in this insightful book. Emerging markets face particular challenges in stabilizing their nascent financial systems in the face of shocks, both domestic and external, and financial reforms are critical to these economies as they pursue programs of sustainable high growth. Low-income countries, where the breadth of formal financial systems is severely limited, pose even greater problems. At the moment, policymakers in emerging markets are struggling to learn from the crisis how they can refashion financial regulatory structures, how they might best contend with multinational financial institutions, and how they can extend financial services to underserved segments of their populations. Masahiro Kawai, Eswar Prasad, and their contributors offer a systematic overview of recent developments in —and the latest thinking about —regulatory frameworks in both advanced countries and emerging markets. At the same time, their contributions clearly point out the challenges to improving regulation, markets, and access in developing economies. Topics include • Rewriting Financial Sector Regulation • Evaluating U.S. Plans for Financial Regulatory Reform • Emerging Contours of Financial Regulation • What Regulatory Policies Are Suitable for Emerging Markets • Banking Supervision in Indonesia • Containing a Systemic Crisis: Is There a Playbook? • Financial Development: A Broader Perspective • Financial Development in Emerging Markets: The Indian Experience • Universalizing Complete Access to Finance","2011-05-01","http://books.google.es/books?id=6VgPgRKgtiMC&pg=PA132&dq=market%2Bsystemic&hl=&cd=24&source=gbs_api","9780815704904",

"Australia: Addressing Systemic Risk Through Higher Loss Absorbency—Technical Note","market+systemic","[International Monetary Fund]","[Business & Economics]","Australia’s four largest banks can be considered domestically systemic. They make up the lion’s share of the banking system, use similar business models, and are interconnected. The top four banks are relatively similar in terms of systemic importance, partly reflecting the authorities’ ?four pillar? policy, which aims at preventing the number of large banks from falling below four. To deal with systemic risks, the authorities deploy a multi-pronged approach consisting of risk-based supervision, recovery and resolution planning, and conservative risk weights and definitions of loss absorbent capital. Most countries that have already identified strategies to deal with their systemic institutions incorporate higher loss absorbency for systemic institutions in their approach. Market based methodologies using the expected default frequency for systemic institutions can gauge the amount of additional capital—higher loss absorbency—required to reduce the probability of failure of systemic institutions to an acceptable level. Alternatively, the implied funding cost advantage can indicate the degree of systemic importance and be used to define higher capital requirements to offset this implicit subsidy. Application of these methods to Australian banks provides a range of estimates of higher loss absorbency requirements for systemic institutions and a transparent framework for discussion and selection of these requirements.","2012-11-21","http://books.google.es/books?id=B3rD-a5rQgsC&printsec=frontcover&dq=market%2Bsystemic&hl=&cd=37&source=gbs_api","9781616358242",

"Collateral Knowledge. Legal Reasoning in the Global Financial Markets","market+systemic","[Annelise Riles]","[Business & Economics]","Who are the agents of financial regulation? Is good (or bad) financial governance merely the work of legislators and regulators? Here Annelise Riles argues that financial governance is made not just through top-down laws and policies but also through the daily use of mundane legal techniques such as collateral by a variety of secondary agents, from legal technicians and retail investors to financiers and academics and even computerized trading programs. Drawing upon her ten years of ethnographic fieldwork in the Japanese derivatives market, Riles explores the uses of collateral in the financial markets as a regulatory device for stabilizing market transactions. How collateral operates, Riles suggests, is paradigmatic of a class of low-profile, mundane, but indispensable activities and practices that are all too often ignored as we think about how markets should work and be governed. Riles seeks to democratize our understanding of legal techniques, and demonstrate how these day-to-day private actions can be reformed to produce more effective forms of market regulation.","2011-05-01","http://books.google.es/books?id=4ek6zWSyknMC&pg=PA146&dq=market%2Bsystemic&hl=&cd=40&source=gbs_api","9780226719337",

Not surprisingly, we find that Europe is more financially integrated than other regions. Asia, more interestingly, already seems to have made more progress on this front than Latin America and other parts of the world. The contrast with Latin America is largely explained by stronger creditor and investor rights, better contract enforcement, and greater transparency, all of which are conducive to foreign participation in local markets and to intraregional cross holdings of Asian bonds generally. Further results based on a limited sample suggest that one factor holding back investment in foreign bonds in East Asia may be limited geographical diversification by mutual funds, in turn reflecting a dearth of appropriate assets. Asian Bond Fund 2, by creating a passively managed portfolio of local currency bonds potentially attractive to mutual fund managers and investors, may help to relax this constraint.","2006-10-01","http://books.google.es/books?id=IlMaRZ1tBXkC&pg=PA13&dq=market%2Bbond%2Breturn&hl=&cd=5&source=gbs_api","9781451909517",

"The Impact of Macroeconomic Announcements on Emerging Market Bonds","market+bond+return","[Geoffrey J. Bannister, Natalia T.

Global bond spreads respond to rating actions and changes in global interest rates rather than domestic data and policy announcements. All announcements affect market volatility. Data and policy announcements reduce uncertainty and stabilize the trading environment, while rating actions cause greater volatility. Results are broadly robust to country-specific and panel analyses, assuming conditional variance and controlling for the surprise content of news. In subsamples, announcements are found to matter less for countries with more transparent policies and higher credit ratings. In a crisis, rating actions become less important, and investors focus more on simple and timely indicators, like CPI.","2005-04-01","http://books.google.es/books?id=J76J8ICNHfIC&pg=PA7&dq=market%2Bbond%2Breturn&hl=&cd=9&source=gbs_api","The Impact of Macro",

This reflects the combined effect of the 1980s debt crisis and much higher returns during 1989-2000.

"The Repo Handbook","market+bond+return","[Moorad Choudhry]","[Business & Economics]","The Repo Handbook, 2nd edition presents an overview of repo vehicles and markets with sufficient depth for those seeking detailed explanations. In three parts it demonstrates how these secured loans fit into global capital markets and why they account for up to 50% of daily settlement activity in non-US government bonds worldwide. This new edition replaces old examples and introduces new developments, such as structured finance repo and associated topics such as Basel II regulatory rules. In addition, 12 of 18 chapters feature new sections and 4 have been substantially rewritten. The UK gilt and US Treasury repo markets are explored through worked examples, and there are new sections on funding arbitrage trades, risk exposures, and regulatory capital. It also places repo in context within bank asset-liability management and trading techniques, illustrating repo use across a wide range of applications in the global money markets. Rarely mentioned in the financial press because of the simple, straightforward nature of the instrument, repo was often the only funding source available to banks during the last quarter of 2008 and the first in 2009. This book, written by a trader, will draw new attention to this valuable and efficient funding and investment product. * Describes repo instruments, which appeal to market participants because of their simplicity and malleability * Explains the institutional treatment of repos, especially in terms of risk, accounting, tax and legal issues, and equity repo * Details the government bond basis, implied repo rate, and basis trading","2010-04-06","http://books.google.es/books?id=igVeegtXp1cC&pg=PA26&dq=market%2Bbond%2Breturn&hl=&cd=27&source=gbs_api","9780080941554",

Shareholder advantage has no significant effect on distress risk premia in stock or bond returns for firms with bonds outstanding. I also find that the negative relationship between distress risk and stock returns is more evident for firms with high trading cost and arbitrage risk.

The region now has a well developed banking system and boasts four of the top 20 stock markets in the world. Its bond markets, however, are relatively small and at an early stage of development. This report provides a comprehensive survey of the East Asian bond markets, identifies best practices for fostering their development, and presents a broad agenda of reforms for their further development.

In fact, though this issue has been discussed for a while now, the Asian financial crisis re-emphasised its importance, and it is worth discussing this issue in the framework of the post-crisis landscape. The second ""Round Table on Capital Market Reforms in Asia"" held in Tokyo in April 2000, which was organised by the OECD and the Asian Development Bank Institute (ADBI), focused on bond market development in Asia. Bond market development involves a number of inter-related issues and it is not an easy task, especially for emerging economies. Though there have been a number of positive developments in Asia in this field, it is also true that it takes time for a bond market to become well-developed in Asia. This publication is based on a summary of the proceedings of the second Round Table, together with papers on the experience of both Asian and OECD countries presented at the meeting and on the discussions by the participants. This volume will surely serve as an indispensable source of information on capital market reform, and in particular on bond market development in Asia; it will constitute a reference book on those topics for policy-makers and experts in both the public and private sectors.","2001-01-01","http://books.google.es/books?id=D5yGsL-_KvgC&pg=PA346&dq=market%2Bbond%2Breturn&hl=&cd=40&source=gbs_api","9789264186293",

It has since become the classic source on the topic. This new edition is completely updated to include the latest ripples in chaos theory with new chapters that tie in today's hot innovations, such as fuzzy logic, neural nets, and artificial intelligence. Critical praise for Peters and the first edition of Chaos and Order in the Capital Markets ""The bible of market chaologists."" - BusinessWeek ""Ed Peters has written a first-class summary suitable for any investment professional or skilled investor."" - Technical Analysis of Stocks & Commodities ""It ranks among the most provocative financial books of the past few years. Reading this book will provide a generous payback for the time and mental energy expended."" - Financial Analysts Journal This second edition of Chaos and Order in the Capital Markets brings the topic completely up to date with timely examples from today's markets and descriptions of the latest wave of technology, including genetic algorithms, wavelets, and complexity theory. Chaos and Order in the Capital Markets was the very first book to explore and popularize chaos theory as it applies to finance. It has since become the industry standard, and is regarded as the definitive source to which analysts, investors, and traders turn for a comprehensive overview of chaos theory. Now, this invaluable reference - touted by BusinessWeek as ""the bible of market chaologists"" - has been updated and revised to bring you the latest developments in the field. Mainstream capital market theory is based on efficient market assumptions, even though the markets themselves exhibit characteristics that are symptomatic of nonlinear dynamic systems. As it explores - and validates - this nonlinear nature, Chaos and Order repudiates the ""random walk"" theory and econometrics. It shifts the focus away from the concept of efficient markets toward a more general view of the forces underlying the capital market system. Presenting new analytical techniques, as well as reexamining methods that have been in use for the past forty years, Chaos and Order offers a thorough examination of chaos theory and fractals as applied to investments and economics. This new edition includes timely examples from today's markets and descriptions of cutting-edge technologies-genetic algorithms, wavelets, complexity theory-and hot innovations, such as fuzzy logic and artificial intelligence. Beyond the history of current capital market theory, Chaos and Order covers the crucial characteristics of fractals, the analysis of fractal time series through rescaled range analysis (R/S), the specifics of fractal statistics, and the definition and analysis of chaotic systems. It offers an in-depth exploration of: * Random walks and efficient markets - the development of the efficient market hypothesis (EMH) and modern portfolio theory * The linear paradigm - why it has failed * Nonlinear dynamic systems - phase space, the Henon Map, Lyapunov exponents * Applying chaos and nonlinear methods - neural networks, genetic algorithms * Dynamical analysis of time series - reconstructing a phase space, the fractal dimension Tonis Vaga's Coherent Market Hypothesis - the theory of social imitation, control parameters, Vaga's implementations Plus, Chaos and Order now contains a Windows-compatible disk including data sets for running analyses described in the appendices. Written by a leading expert in the field, Chaos and Order in the Capital Markets has all the information you need for a complete, up-to-date look at chaos theory. This latest edition will undoubtedly prove to be as invaluable as the first.","1996-08-30","http://books.google.es/books?id=Qi0meDlDrgQC&pg=PA123&dq=market%2Bchaotic&hl=&cd=7&source=gbs_api","0471139386",

"Conquering the Chaos. Win in India, Win Everywhere","market+chaotic","[Ravi Venkatesan]","[Business & Economics]","India: A Defining Choice for Your Business India is on the minds of business leaders everywhere. Within a few decades, India will be the world’s most populous nation and one of its largest economies. But it is also a complex and challenging market, with a reputation for corruption, uncertainty, and stultifying bureaucracy. The initial infatuation with India is over and reality has set in. But India is not a market that can be ignored. So why take a chance in this extraordinary and complex region? What does it take to win in India? How do you deal with the chaos—and even prosper from it? Ravi Venkatesan, the former Chairman of Microsoft India, offers inside advice on how your firm can overcome the unique challenges of the Indian market. He argues that chaotic India is in fact an archetype for most emerging markets, many of which present similar challenges but not the same potential. Succeeding in India therefore becomes a litmus test for your ability to succeed in other emerging markets. If you can win in India, you can win everywhere. Hard as these markets are, Venkatesan says, for most multinational firms the bigger challenge to success in emerging markets may well be the internal culture and mind-set at headquarters. The unwillingness to make a long-term commitment to the new market or to adequately trust local leadership, combined with the propensity to rigidly replicate the products, business models, and operating systems that have worked at home drives many companies to a “midway trap” that results in India remaining an irrelevantly small contributor to global growth and profits. Combining his personal experience with in-depth research and interviews with CEOs and senior leaders at dozens of companies—including Nokia, GE, JCB, Dell, Honeywell, Volvo, Bosch, Deere, Unilever, and Nestlé—Venkatesan shows you how to tackle slowing growth, policy uncertainty, and corruption and enable your firm to thrive in India. He proves that you can break through successfully, but it takes a very different type of leadership, both locally and at headquarters. If you want to succeed in the twenty-first century, you must succeed in emerging markets. This practical book, written by one of India’s most respected CEOs, will give you the keys to win in India, other emerging markets, and beyond.","2013-12-30","http://books.google.es/books?id=I8GPDRAKLoQC&printsec=frontcover&dq=market%2Bchaotic&hl=&cd=12&source=gbs_api","9781422184318",

"Chaos Control. Theory and Applications","market+chaotic","[Guanrong Chen, Xinghuo Yu]","[Language Arts & Disciplines]","Chaos control refers to purposefully manipulating chaotic dynamical behaviors of some complex nonlinear systems. There exists no similar control theory-oriented book available in the market that is devoted to the subject of chaos control, written by control engineers for control engineers. World-renowned leading experts in the field provide their state-of-the-art survey about the extensive research that has been done over the last few years in this subject. The new technology of chaos control has major impact on novel engineering applications such as telecommunications, power systems, liquid mixing, internet technology, high-performance circuits and devices, biological systems modeling like the brain and the heart, and decision making. The book is not only aimed at active researchers in the field of chaos control involving control and systems engineers, theoretical and experimental physicists, and applied mathematicians, but also at a general audience in related fields.","2003-07-25","http://books.google.es/books?id=zcENqZNQsBAC&printsec=frontcover&dq=market%2Bchaotic&hl=&cd=16&source=gbs_api","3540404058",
"The Philosophy and Economics of Market Socialism : A Critical Study. A Critical Study","market+chaotic","[N. Scott Arnold Professor of Philosophy University of Alabama at Birmingham]","[Business & Economics]","N. Scott Arnold argues that the most defensible version of a market socialist economic system would be unable to realize widely held socialist ideals and values. In particular, it would be responsible for widespread and systematic exploitation. The charge of exploitation, which is really a charge of injustice, has typically been made against capitalist systems by socialists. This book argues that it is market socialism--the only remaining viable form of socialism--that is systematically exploitative.","1994-07-19","http://books.google.es/books?id=1vRhfj0fsSYC&pg=PA79&dq=market%2Bchaotic&hl=&cd=17&source=gbs_api","0195358511",
"Chaos: A Very Short Introduction","market+chaotic","[Leonard Smith]","[Science]","Chaos exists in systems all around us. Even the simplest system of cause and effect can be subject to chaos, denying us accurate predictions of its behaviour, and sometimes giving rise to astonishing structures of large-scale order. Our growing understanding of Chaos Theory is having fascinating applications in the real world - from technology to global warming, politics, human behaviour, and even gambling on the stock market. Leonard Smith shows that we all have an intuitive understanding of chaotic systems. He uses accessible maths and physics (replacing complex equations with simple examples like pendulums, railway lines, and tossing coins) to explain the theory, and points to numerous examples in philosophy and literature (Edgar Allen Poe, Chang-Tzu, Arthur Conan Doyle) that illuminate the problems. The beauty of fractal patterns and their relation to chaos, as well as the history of chaos, and its uses in the real world and implications for the philosophy of science are all discussed in this Very Short Introduction. ABOUT THE SERIES: The Very Short Introductions series from Oxford University Press contains hundreds of titles in almost every subject area. These pocket-sized books are the perfect way to get ahead in a new subject quickly. Our expert authors combine facts, analysis, perspective, new ideas, and enthusiasm to make interesting and challenging topics highly readable.","2007-02-22","http://books.google.es/books?id=iKzM0gEzlScC&pg=PT163&dq=market%2Bchaotic&hl=&cd=18&source=gbs_api","9780191579431",

"Financial Market Risk. Measurement and Analysis","market+chaotic","[Cornelis Los]","[Business & Economics]","This new book uses advanced signal processing technology to measure and analyze risk phenomena of the financial markets. It explains how to scientifically measure, analyze and manage non-stationarity and long-term time dependence (long memory) of financial market returns. It studies, in particular, financial crises in persistent financial markets, such as stock, bond and real estate market, and turbulence in antipersistent financial markets, such as anchor currency markets. It uses Windowed Fourier and Wavelet Multiresolution Analysis to measure the degrees of persistence of these complex markets, by computing monofractal Hurst exponents and multifractal singularity spectra. It explains how and why financial crises and financial turbulence may occur in the various markets and why we may have to reconsider the current wave of term structure modeling based on affine models. It also uses these persistence measurements to improve the financial risk management of global investment funds, via numerical simulations of the nonlinear diffusion equations describing the underlying high frequency dynamic pricing processes.","2006-03-07","http://books.google.es/books?id=Bx3Z9y5mg0MC&pg=PR17&dq=market%2Bchaotic&hl=&cd=23&source=gbs_api","9781134469321",
"Interaction and Market Structure. Essays on Heterogeneity in Economics","market+chaotic","[Domenico Delli Gatti, Mauro Gallegati, Alan P. Kirman]","[Business & Economics]","This book is a collection of essays which examine how the properties of aggregate variables are influenced by the actions and interactions of heterogenous individuals in different economic contexts. The common denominator of the essays is a critique of the representative agent hypothesis. If this hypothesis were correct, the behaviour of the aggregate variable would simply be the reproduction of individual optimising behaviour. In the methodology of the hard sciences, one of the achievements of the quantum revolution has been the rebuttal of the notion that aggregate behaviour can be explained on the basis of the behaviour of a single unit: the elementary particle does not even exist as a single entity but as a network, a system of interacting units. In this book, new tracks in economics which parallel the developments in physics mentioned above are explored. The essays, in fact are contributions to the analysis of the economy as a complex evolving system of interacting agents.","2000-03-27","http://books.google.es/books?id=5D4V5DwKeKgC&pg=PA84&dq=market%2Bchaotic&hl=&cd=24&source=gbs_api","3540669795",

"Chaos: A Statistical Perspective","market+chaotic","[Kung-Sik Chan, Howell Tong]","[Computers]","This book discusses dynamical systems that are typically driven by stochastic dynamic noise. It is written by two statisticians essentially for the statistically inclined readers, although readers whose primary interests are in determinate systems will find some of the methodology explained in this book of interest. The statistical approach adopted in this book differs in many ways from the deterministic approach to dynamical systems. Even the very basic notion of initial-value sensitivity requires careful development in the new setting provided. This book covers, in varying depth, many of the contributions made by the statisticians in the past twenty years or so towards our understanding of estimation, the Lyapunov-like index, the nonparametric regression, and many others, many of which are motivated by their dynamical system counterparts but have now acquired a distinct statistical flavour. Kung-Sik Chan is a professor at the University of Iowa, Department of Statistics and Actuarial Science. He is an elected member of the International Statistical Institute. He has served on the editorial boards of the Journal of Business and Economic Statistics and Statistica Sinica. He received a Faculty Scholar Award from the University of Iowa in 1996.

"Testing for Nonlinearity and Deterministic Chaos in Stock Market Data: Results for Monthly TOPIX Time Series","market+chaotic","[National University of Singapore. Dept. of Information Systems and Computer Science, Teo Jasic, Hean Lee Poh]","[Chaotic behavior in systems]","Abstract: ""It has been widely recognized that the randomness of a stock market may actually be an indicator of an underlying strange attractor which has a fractal structure and supports chaotic motion. The application of nonlinear methods to such financial data may indicate the presence of nonlinearities and low-dimensional chaos. These methods include rescaled range (R/S) analysis, correlation dimension calculation and estimation of Lyapunov exponents. This study presents a preliminary analysis of these tests when applied to the monthly TOPIX data of the Tokyo Stock Exchange. Although there are a number of limitations for applied nonlinear methods such as the presence of noise and limited data size, the results indicate the presence of nonlinearities and the long memory effect in the observed data set. In order to complement these methods, neural networks are used for nonlinear modeling and prediction of the TOPIX data. The results can serve as an additional evidence of a deterministic system by giving accuracy estimates for short-term prediction.""","1994","http://books.google.es/books?id=S9UKHAAACAAJ&dq=market%2Bchaotic&hl=&cd=39&source=gbs_api","OCLC:32842240",

Details on the script development, cast, crew, locations, and even basic information on running times and release dates have been sketchy at best since the film's 1951 release. This work reconstructs the circumstances surrounding this unusual international co-production (Atoll K was a French-Italian film with English-speaking stars). Through lost documents detailing the film's production and funding, previously unreleased behind-the-scenes photos, and a rare interview with French movie star Suzy Delair, the author explores the continuous changes to the film's script during its chaotic production and the final marketing of the film's many different versions (Atoll K was also released as Robinson Crusoeland in the United Kingdom and as Utopia in the United States). Several appendices detail alternative sequences and cut scenes in various versions of the film and include French box-office reports from 1951 to 1952 as well as a complete filmography.","2008-07-23","http://books.google.es/books?id=1ZpbpOQt9cQC&printsec=frontcover&dq=market%2Bchaotic&hl=&cd=40&source=gbs_api","9780786451746",

"Systemic Lupus Erythematosus","stable+systemic","[Robert G. Lahita, George Tsokos, Jill P. Buyon, Takao Koike]","[Medical]","Systemic lupus erythematosus (S.L.E.), commonly called lupus, is a chronic autoimmune disorder that can affect virtually any organ of the body. In lupus, the body's immune system, which normally functions to protect against foreign invaders, becomes hyperactive, forming antibodies that attack normal tissues and organs, including the skin, joints, kidneys, brain, heart, lungs, and blood. Lupus is characterized by periods of illness, called flares, and periods of wellness, or remission. Because its symptoms come and go and mimic those of other diseases, lupus is difficult to diagnose. There is no single laboratory test that can definitively prove that a person has the complex illness. To date, lupus has no known cause or cure. Early detection and treatment is the key to a better health outcome and can usually lessen the progression and severity of the disease. Anti-inflammatory drugs, anti-malarials, and steroids (such as cortisone and others) are often used to treat lupus. Cytotoxic chemotherapies, similar to those used in the treatment of cancer, are also used to suppress the immune system in lupus patients. A new edition of this established and well regarded reference which combines basic science with clinical science to provide a translational medicine model. Systemic Lupus Erythematosus is a useful reference for specialists in the diagnosis and management of patients with SLE, a tool for measurement of clinical activity for pharmaceutical development and basic research of the disease and a reference work for hospital libraries. * Highly illustrated and in full color throughout * Basic science section expanded to allow the reader to focus on the newest techniques in molecular medicine and its effects on disease expression and treatment * Clinical aspects and new drugs will be covered in great detail providing a useful reference to both experienced clinicians and physicians with an interest in lupus in their clinical practice","2010-10-29","http://books.google.es/books?id=qqq450swSv0C&pg=PA795&dq=stable%2Bsystemic&hl=&cd=4&source=gbs_api","9780080961712",
"Measuring Systemic Risk-Adjusted Liquidity (SRL) - A Model Approach","stable+systemic","[Andreas Jobst]","[Business & Economics]","Little progress has been made so far in addressing—in a comprehensive way—the externalities caused by impact of the interconnectedness within institutions and markets on funding and market liquidity risk within financial systems. The Systemic Risk-adjusted Liquidity (SRL) model combines option pricing with market information and balance sheet data to generate a probabilistic measure of the frequency and severity of multiple entities experiencing a joint liquidity event. It links a firm’s maturity mismatch between assets and liabilities impacting the stability of its funding with those characteristics of other firms, subject to individual changes in risk profiles and common changes in market conditions. This approach can then be used (i) to quantify an individual institution’s time-varying contribution to system-wide liquidity shortfalls and (ii) to price liquidity risk within a macroprudential framework that, if used to motivate a capital charge or insurance premia, provides incentives for liquidity managers to internalize the systemic risk of their decisions. The model can also accommodate a stress testing approach for institution-specific and/or general funding shocks that generate estimates of systemic liquidity risk (and associated charges) under adverse scenarios.","2012-08-01","http://books.google.es/books?id=21oOVVMTypgC&pg=PA17&dq=stable%2Bsystemic&hl=&cd=5&source=gbs_api","9781475576634",

This monograph tackles managerial problems from an holistic perspective such as how a business entity grows and dies and how a CEO can manipulate the choices of long- and short-term projects in order to gain more control over the board of directors. By creating a uniform language and logic of reasoning, the book provides examples and convincing results. Additionally the book shows how the same model, thinking logic, and methodology of the systems research can be equally applied to analyze problems and situations considered in natural sciences, social sciences, and humanity areas. Therefore it offers knowledge of a brand new tool to attack organizational problems. By concentrating on difficult, unsettled issues in these varying areas, this monograph thoroughly explains how some laws of nature can be established for the common study of natural and social sciences.","2011-12-15","http://books.google.es/books?id=B9eqmWnCcSsC&pg=PA129&dq=stable%2Bsystemic&hl=&cd=15&source=gbs_api","9781461423119",

Towards A General Theory of Emergence - Proceedings of the International Conference","stable+systemic","[Gianfranco Minati]","[Emergence (Philosophy)]","This book contains the Proceedings of the 2007 Conference of the Italian Systems Society. Papers deal with the interdisciplinary study of processes of emergence, considering theoretical aspects and applications from physics, cognitive science, biology, artificial intelligence, economics, architecture, philosophy, music and social systems. Such an interdisciplinary study implies the need to model and distinguish, in different disciplinary contexts, the establishment of structures, systems and systemic properties. Systems, as modeled by the observer, not only possess properties, but are also able to make emergent new properties. While current disciplinary models of emergence are based on theories of phase transitions, bifurcations, dissipative structures, multiple systems and organization, the present volume focuses on both generalizing those disciplinary models and identifying correspondences and new more general approaches. The general conceptual framework of the book relates to the attempt to build a general theory of emergence as a general theory of change, corresponding to Von Bertalanffy's project for a general system theory.","2008-12-04","http://books.google.es/books?id=ti8jaTnVnyEC&pg=PA681&dq=stable%2Bsystemic&hl=&cd=18&source=gbs_api","981279347X",

"The Politics of the Euro-Zone : Stability or Breakdown?. Stability or Breakdown?","stable+systemic","[Kenneth Dyson]",,"The Euro-Zone represents the single most important step in European Integration since 1957 and one of the boldest economic, monetary, and political projects in modern history. In this first major study, the author examines the major political questions raised by the birth of the Euro-Zone on January 1 1999 and argues for a more politically informed analysis and assessment of its nature, operation, and prospects. How does the Euro-Zone operate? What does it mean for European States and for the political strategies of governments? How is its operation to be explained? What are its prospects for stability? What kinds of policies are needed to strengthen its capacity to withstand crisis? The book stresses the ECB-centric nature of the Euro-Zone and its implications both for policy and polices in Europe and for theories of integration. The ECB emerges as a powerful 'policy pusher' and 'ideational leader', with an authority and power exceeding that of the European Commission in the integration process. Dyson examines the elated problems of social justice, democratic consent, and identity. He also argues that the Euro-Zone represents a process of transition to the EU as a 'stabilization Staten An innovative aspect of the book is its application of a strength-strain model for the purpose of analyzing and assessing the stability of the Euro-Zone. It concludes that the stability of the Euro-Zone will be strongly conditioned by three factors: how Kantian rather than Hobbesian or Lockeian its political culture proves to be, with a key reproducibility failing here on the quality of political leadership; its possession of policy interments to tackle liquidity as well as debt traps; and the speed and efficiency of mechanisms of 'bench marking, policy transfer, and 'lesson-drawing'.","2000-09-28","http://books.google.es/books?id=oq3Bc1XNkEUC&pg=PA170&dq=stable%2Bsystemic&hl=&cd=21&source=gbs_api","0191529176",

"Unlocking Credit. The Quest for Deep and Stable Bank Lending","stable+systemic","[Inter-American Development Bank Staff]","[Business & Economics]","Bank loans are the main source of credit for businesses across Latin America, so understanding what determines the depth, cost, and volatility of bank credit is crucial to designing strategies that ensure financial stability and promote growth. This new edition of ""Economic and Social Progress in Latin America"" provides a comprehensive analysis of the region's all-important banking industry. The book examines two-way interactions between macroeconomic policies and financial intermediation -- not only how these policies affect banking but how banks weather intermediate shocks, and how industry incentives can prompt bank portfolio choices that influence economic policy. The report also discusses how elements of a financial safety net -- including deposit insurance, prudential regulation, protection of creditor rights, and legal and judicial enforcement -- can mitigate factors that make credit more volatile and constrain its expansion. Finally, the report studies how the banking industry's market structure,affects its performance. Particular attention is given to the role of government- versus foreign-owned banks, access to credit by small and medium-sized enterprises, and the development of mortgage credit markets.","2004","http://books.google.es/books?id=5lMTxWGjn6gC&pg=PA29&dq=stable%2Bsystemic&hl=&cd=36&source=gbs_api","9781931003667",

"Functional Hemodynamic Monitoring","stable+systemic","[Michael R. Pinsky, Didier Payen]","[Medical]","Hemodynamic monitoring is one of the major diagnostic tools available in the acute care setting to diagnose cardiovascular insufficiency and monitor changes over time in response to interventions. However, the rationale and efficacy of hemodynamic monitoring to affect outcome has come into question. We now have increasing evidence that outcome from critical illness can be improved by focused resuscitation based on existing hemodynamic monitoring, whereas non-specific aggressive resuscitation impairs survival. Thus, this book frames hemodynamic monitoring into a functional perspective wherein hemodynamic variables and physiology interact to derive performance and physiological reserve estimates that themselves drive treatment. This philosophy, as well as the limitations and applications of common and evolving hemodynamic measures and their focused use in the care of critically ill patients are discussed, relevant to one underlying truth: No monitoring device, no matter how simple or sophisticated, will improve patient-centered outcomes useless coupled to a treatment which, itself, improves outcome.","2004-10-19","http://books.google.es/books?id=ogNuFmVoA4YC&pg=PA287&dq=stable%2Bsystemic&hl=&cd=38&source=gbs_api","3540223495",
"Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease. Co-Morbidities and Systemic Consequences","stable+systemic","[Linda Nici, Richard ZuWallack]","[Medical]","Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. By 2020, COPD is expected to be the fifth leading cause of disability and the third leading cause of death. COPD is associated with significant co-morbid illnesses including cardiovascular disease, pulmonary vascular disease, osteoporosis, depression and thoracic malignancies. In addition, COPD patients often have systemic manifestations of their disease, including peripheral muscle dysfunction, decreased activity levels and nutritional abnormalities, all of which contribute to poor functional status, decreased quality of life and increased health care utilization. Lack of recognition and understanding of the complex interactions of these common co-morbid conditions and systemic effects often contributes to sub-optimal care for patients with COPD. Comprehensive in covering the range of co-morbidities that often accompany COPD, Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease: Co-Morbidities and Systemic Consequences provides a concise, evidence-based review of the problem and its systemic manifestations. All physicians interested in this growing disorder from subspecialists to primary care providers will find in this timely and informative title the practical, state-of-the art approaches needed to provide targeted, integrated care for patients with COPD.","2011-11-06","http://books.google.es/books?id=0CXcUnr-0eoC&pg=PA146&dq=stable%2Bsystemic&hl=&cd=39&source=gbs_api","1607616734",

This volume applies a brand new logic of reasoning to some of the unsett led problems in the area of money and banking.

That is, the learning of this particular subject matter takes place at a different, more elevated level, from which, among others, economies are respectively seen as both closed and open systems; their interactions emulate those of rotational pools of fluids.

"Flexible Exchange Rates for a Stable World Economy","stable+bond+return","[Joseph E. Gagnon, Marc Hinterschweiger]","[Business & Economics]","Volatile exchange rates and how to manage them are a contentious topic whenever economic policymakers gather in international meetings. This book examines the broad parameters of exchange rate policy in light of both high-powered theory and real-world experience. What are the costs and benefits of flexible versus fixed exchange rates? How much of a role should the exchange rate play in monetary policy? Why don't volatile exchange rates destabilize inflation and output? The principal finding of this book is that using monetary policy to fight exchange rate volatility, including through the adoption of a fixed exchange rate regime, leads to greater volatility of employment, output, and inflation. In other words, the ""cure"" for exchange rate volatility is worse than the disease. This finding is demonstrated in economic models, in historical case studies, and in statistical analysis of the data. The book devotes considerable attention to understanding the reasons why volatile exchange rates do not destabilize inflation and output. The book concludes that many countries would benefit from allowing greater flexibility of their exchange rates in order to target monetary policy at stabilization of their domestic economies. Few, if any, countries would benefit from a move in the opposite direction.","2011","http://books.google.es/books?id=nAntvbMey2AC&pg=PA31&dq=stable%2Bbond%2Breturn&hl=&cd=6&source=gbs_api","9780881326352",

"Wall Street Revalued. Imperfect Markets and Inept Central Bankers","stable+bond+return","[Andrew Smithers]","[Business & Economics]","In 2000 one of the world’s foremost economists, Andrew Smithers, showed that the US stock market was widely over-priced at its peak and correctly advised investors to sell. He also argued that central bankers should adjust their policies not only in light of expected inflation but also if stock prices reach excessive levels. At the time, few economists agreed with him, today it is hard to find those who would disagree. In the past central bankers have denied that markets can be valued and that it did not matter if they fell. These two intellectual mistakes are the fundamentals cause of the current financial market crisis. In addition, a lack of understanding by investors as to how to value the market has also resulted in widespread losses. It is clearly of great importance to everyone that neither these losses nor the current financial chaos should be repeated and thus that the principle of asset valuation should be widely understood. In this timely and thought-provoking sequel to the hugely successful Valuing Wall Street Andrew Smithers puts forward a coherent and testable economic theory in order to influence investors, pension consultants and central bankers policy decisions so that thy may prevent history repeating itself. Backed by theory and substantial evidence Andrew shows that assets can be valued, as financial markets are neither perfectly efficient nor absurd casinos.","2009-09-22","http://books.google.es/books?id=hp-HPQGEaQYC&pg=PT40&dq=stable%2Bbond%2Breturn&hl=&cd=10&source=gbs_api","9780470750056",

"China and Asia. Economic and Financial Interactions","stable+bond+return","[Yin-Wong Cheung, Kar-Yiu Wong]","[Business & Economics]","It is difficult to overstate the growing importance of China and Asia in the global economy. Despite the sharp downturn experienced in the 1997 financial crisis, China and Asia have bounced back strongly in the new millennium and delivered solid economic growth. In this book, Ying-Wong Cheung and Kar-Yiu Wong have gathered together 35 renowned researchers from four continents to examine contemporary issues on the economic and financial interactions with a focus on China and Asia. Four broad areas are discussed. The first part deals with China and her interactions with other economies, the second with economic interactions within the region, the third with foreign exchange rate issues facing Asian economies, and the fourth with financial market development in the region. Within these chapters, some interesting results are explained, many of which differ from what is commonly believed. For example it is explained how exports from China and other Asian economies follow the ""flying geese’ pattern and that these economies can grow in harmony; that appreciating the Asian exchange rates would not have much impact on their current account surpluses; that financial liberalization in Thailand did not create the short-term debt problem, which is believed to a major cause of the 1997 financial crisis. It is also described how developments in the US have very strong influences on Asian economies and that Mainland China was a less important source of external shocks than is commonly held.","2008-12-05","http://books.google.es/books?id=du2SAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA226&dq=stable%2Bbond%2Breturn&hl=&cd=13&source=gbs_api","9781135971625",

"Equity Prices, Credit Default Swaps, and Bond Spreads in Emerging Markets","stable+bond+return",,"[Bonds]","This paper examines equilibrium price relationships and price discovery between credit defaul swap (CDS), bond, and equity markets for emerging market sovereign issuers. Findings suggest that CDS and bond spreads converge despite various pressures that arise in the market. In most countries, however, we do not find any equilibrium price relationship between the bond and CDS markets and the equity markets. As for price discovery, our results are mixed. This stands in contrast to the empirical findings on corporate issuers in the United States and Europe.","2004-02-01","http://books.google.es/books?id=KXNcJi0lDvoC&pg=PA8&dq=stable%2Bbond%2Breturn&hl=&cd=21&source=gbs_api","Equity Prices, Cred",

"From Here to Economy. A Shortcut to Economic Literacy","stable+bond+return","[Todd G. Buchholz]","[Business & Economics]","What is the GDP, and what does it mean? Why does the stock market go down when interest rates go up? What causes a dreaded recession? Economics impacts everyone's life, but most people take on faith what they read in the newspaper. Now, for anyone who doesn't know much about economics, noted economist Todd Buchholz explains it all simply and clearly. With refreshing wit and irreverence, Buchholz takes readers by the hand and reveals the basic rules behind everything from food prices to trade deficits. Instead of complicated graphs and charts he uses examples from contemporary life and popular culture to demonstrate the principles at work. By cutting through the arcane musings of academicians, the jargon of analysts and advisors, and the rhetoric of politicians, he gives us a precise and accessible understanding of economic ideas, actions, and consequences as they actually exist in the here and now. Here are some of the heretofore unintelligible ideas he helps us to understand: what causes or combats inflation, and why it is so feared; what moves stocks and bonds up and down - and how to invest wisely and safely; whether it is good or bad to ""protect"" America from foreign goods - and what happens when we do and when we don't; what exactly Social Security is, and whether government spending is good or bad - and how dangerous the national debt is or isn't. In today's confusing economic climate, it has never been more important for everyone from homemakers to small-business owners to individual investors and middle managers to understand the forces at work.","1996-05-01","http://books.google.es/books?id=y_R17da6eEIC&pg=PT149&dq=stable%2Bbond%2Breturn&hl=&cd=27&source=gbs_api","9781101563724",

"Stable and Random Motions in Dynamical Systems. With Special Emphasis on Celestial Mechanics","stable+chaotic","[Jürgen Moser]","[Mathematics]","For centuries, astronomers have been interested in the motions of the planets and in methods to calculate their orbits. Since Newton, mathematicians have been fascinated by the related N-body problem. They seek to find solutions to the equations of motion for N masspoints interacting with an inverse-square-law force and to determine whether there are quasi-periodic orbits or not. Attempts to answer such questions have led to the techniques of nonlinear dynamics and chaos theory. In this book, a classic work of modern applied mathematics, Jürgen Moser presents a succinct account of two pillars of the theory: stable and chaotic behavior. He discusses cases in which N-body motions are stable, covering topics such as Hamiltonian systems, the (Moser) twist theorem, and aspects of Kolmogorov-Arnold-Moser theory. He then explores chaotic orbits, exemplified in a restricted three-body problem, and describes the existence and importance of homoclinic points. This book is indispensable for mathematicians, physicists, and astronomers interested in the dynamics of few- and many-body systems and in fundamental ideas and methods for their analysis. After thirty years, Moser's lectures are still one of the best entrées to the fascinating worlds of order and chaos in dynamics.","1973","http://books.google.es/books?id=lVpTfqK93R0C&printsec=frontcover&dq=stable%2Bchaotic&hl=&cd=8&source=gbs_api","0691089108",

The progress of the theory of chaos has a profound impact on galactic dynamics. It has even invaded celestial mechanics, since chaos was found in the solar system which in the past was considered as a prototype of order. The book provides a unifying approach to these topics from an author who has spent more than 50 years of research in the field. The first part treats order and chaos in general. The other two parts deal with order and chaos in galaxies and with other applications in dynamical astronomy, ranging from celestial mechanics to general relativity and cosmology.

"Dynamical Systems. Stability, Controllability and Chaotic Behavior","stable+chaotic","[Werner Krabs]","[Science]","At the end of the nineteenth century Lyapunov and Poincaré developed the so called qualitative theory of differential equations and introduced geometric- topological considerations which have led to the concept of dynamical systems. In its present abstract form this concept goes back to G.D. Birkhoff. This is also the starting point of Chapter 1 of this book in which uncontrolled and controlled time-continuous and time-discrete systems are investigated. Controlled dynamical systems could be considered as dynamical systems in the strong sense, if the controls were incorporated into the state space. We, however, adapt the conventional treatment of controlled systems as in control theory. We are mainly interested in the question of controllability of dynamical systems into equilibrium states. In the non-autonomous time-discrete case we also consider the problem of stabilization. We conclude with chaotic behavior of autonomous time discrete systems and actual real-world applications.","2010-08-03","http://books.google.es/books?id=kUoskOuZdFsC&printsec=frontcover&dq=stable%2Bchaotic&hl=&cd=14&source=gbs_api","9783642137228",

"Stable and Unstable Manifolds in Open Chaotic Systems","stable+chaotic","[Andreas Wingen]","[Science]","On the basis of the Hamiltonian mapping technique, the transport mechanisms of heat and particles in stochastic fusion plasmas are studied. The chaotic motion inside the plasma as well as the wall patterns, created by open chaotic systems like the DED at TEXTOR, are analyzed. For this, the concept of the stable and unstable manifolds is used. Starting with a basic model, the symmetric tokamap as well as the revtokamap, and continued with a simplified realistic model, the cylindrical DED model, the field line transport is analyzed. The typical structures in open, partially stochastic systems and their connections to the stable and unstable manifolds are explained. Then the cylindrical model is generalized to the real toroidal TEXTOR-DED model. The Hamiltonian for a relativistic guiding-center model is derived and a 4-dimensional mapping procedure is constructed. The drift effects are studied for the unperturbed and the perturbed case. Finally, measurements of heat flux patterns at the divertor plates of the TEXTOR-DED are compared to theoretically calculated ones and their structures are analyzed and explained, using the stable and unstable manifolds.","2009-04-01","http://books.google.es/books?id=XHdnPgAACAAJ&dq=stable%2Bchaotic&hl=&cd=16&source=gbs_api","3838106202",

"The Clinical Practice of Complementary, Alternative, and Western Medicine","stable+chaotic","[W. John Diamond]","[Medical]","""Western Medicine"", ""Alternative Medicine"", ""Complementary Medicine"", ""Holistic Medicine"", and ""Natural Medicine."" There is really only one ""medicine"" that heals and puts the whole patient, not the disease, at the center of care: Integrated Medicine. This practice integrates all modalities of healing to produce not merely a medical cure, but a deeper healing of the patient on his or her own terms. The Clinical Practice of Complementary, Alternative, and Western Medicine is a scientifically based text that informs and leads the practitioner easily through the maze of alternative therapies. Unlike other books that address the different alternative modalities, this text integrates homeopathy, acupuncture, chinese herbology, western herbology, and clinical nutrition, then combines them with traditional medicine. The author explains the new paradigm of patient-centered and Integrated Medicine and includes an extensive section on the physical underpinnings of this new paradigm, a paradigm that employs thermodynamics, non linear dynamics, chaos theory, and fractal geometry in an easy to understand discourse. The book incorporates the author's fundamental training in the alternative modalities and his ten years of clinical practice, a practice in which multiple integrated modalities of healing were utilized in the healing of over 10,000 patients. The Clinical Practice of Complementary, Alternative, and Western Medicine is a tremendously valuable reference for practitioners who want to learn about and practice alternative therapies and those who want to be more informed about what their patients may be doing and taking, and the influences those self-administered therapies may be having on their care.","2000-09-26","http://books.google.es/books?id=KECumbYp-dkC&pg=PA35&dq=stable%2Bchaotic&hl=&cd=20&source=gbs_api","0849313996",

"Adventures in Order and Chaos. A Scientific Autobiography","stable+chaotic","[George Contopoulos]","[Science]","The field of Order and Chaos had a remarkable expansion in the last 50 years. The main reason was the use of computers, and the development of new theoretical methods that we call now 'the theory of chaos'.The author describes this fascinating period in a relaxed and sometimes humorous autobiographical way. He relates his interactions with many people in dynamical astronomy and he quotes several anecdotes from these interactions. He refers also to his experiences when he served in various international positions, such as general secretary of the IAU and chairman of the journal Astronomy and Astrophysics. In recent years the theory of chaos has been extended to new areas, like relativity, cosmology and quantum mechanics and it continues expanding in almost all branches of physics. The book describes many important ideas in this field in a simple way. It refers also to problems of more general interest, like writing papers and giving lectures and the interaction of authors and referees. Finally it gives some useful prospects for the future of dynamical astronomy and related fields.

"Chaotic Billiards","stable+chaotic","[Nikolai Chernov, Roberto Markarian]","[Mathematics]","This book covers one of the most exciting but most difficult topics in the modern theory of dynamical systems: chaotic billiards. In physics, billiard models describe various mechanical processes, molecular dynamics, and optical phenomena. The theory of chaotic billiards has made remarkable progress in the past thirty-five years, but it remains notoriously difficult for the beginner, with main results scattered in hardly accessible research articles. This is the first and so faronly book that covers all the fundamental facts about chaotic billiards in a complete and systematic manner. The book contains all the necessary definitions, full proofs of all the main theorems, and many examples and illustrations that help the reader to understand the material. Hundreds of carefullydesigned exercises allow the reader not only to become familiar with chaotic billiards but to master the subject. The book addresses graduate students and young researchers in physics and mathematics. Prerequisites include standard graduate courses in measure theory, probability, Riemannian geometry, topology, and complex analysis.

"Complex Systems Approach to Economic Dynamics","stable+chaotic","[Abraham C.-L. Chian]","[Business & Economics]","Economic Systems exhibit complex dynamics evidenced by large-amplitude and aperiodic fluctuations in economic variables, such as foreign exchange rates and stock market prices, indicating that these systems are driven far from the equilibrium. Characterization of the complex behavior of economic cycles, by identifying regular and irregular patterns and regime switching in economic time series, is the key for pattern recognition and forecasting of economic cycles. Statistical analysis of stock markets and foreign exchange markets has demonstrated the intermittent nature of economic time series. A nonlinear model of business cycles is able to simulate intermittency arising from order-chaos and chaos-chaos transitions. This monograph introduces new concepts of unstable periodic orbits and chaotic saddles which are unstable structures embedded in a chaotic attractor, responsible for economic intermittency.","2007-08-17","http://books.google.es/books?id=w_QBgzbeHcYC&pg=PA63&dq=stable%2Bchaotic&hl=&cd=26&source=gbs_api","9783540397533",

"Complex Population Dynamics. A Theoretical/empirical Synthesis","stable+chaotic","[Peter Turchin]","[Science]","Why do organisms become extremely abundant one year and then seem to disappear a few years later? Why do population outbreaks in particular species happen more or less regularly in certain locations, but only irregularly (or never at all) in other locations? Complex population dynamics have fascinated biologists for decades. By bringing together mathematical models, statistical analyses, and field experiments, this book offers a comprehensive new synthesis of the theory of population oscillations. Peter Turchin first reviews the conceptual tools that ecologists use to investigate population oscillations, introducing population modeling and the statistical analysis of time series data. He then provides an in-depth discussion of several case studies--including the larch budmoth, southern pine beetle, red grouse, voles and lemmings, snowshoe hare, and ungulates--to develop a new analysis of the mechanisms that drive population oscillations in nature. Through such work, the author argues, ecologists can develop general laws of population dynamics that will help turn ecology into a truly quantitative and predictive science. Complex Population Dynamics integrates theoretical and empirical studies into a major new synthesis of current knowledge about population dynamics. It is also a pioneering work that sets the course for ecology's future as a predictive science.","2003-01","http://books.google.es/books?id=GwwkjhlmM8AC&pg=PA148&dq=stable%2Bchaotic&hl=&cd=28&source=gbs_api","0691090211",

"Progress in Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Research","nuclear+systemic","[Tomas I. Seward]","[Medical]","This new book is devoted to leading-edge research developments in lupus which is a condition of chronic inflammation caused by an autoimmune disease. Autoimmune diseases are illnesses that occur when the body's tissues are attacked by its own immune system. The immune system is a complex system within the body that is designed to fight infectious agents, for example, bacteria, and other foreign invaders. One of the mechanisms that the immune system uses to fight infections is the production of antibodies. Patients with lupus produce abnormal antibodies in their blood that target tissues within their own body rather than foreign infectious agents. Because the antibodies and accompanying cells of inflammation can involve tissues anywhere in the body, lupus has the potential to affect a variety of areas of the body. Sometimes lupus can cause disease of the skin, heart, lungs, kidneys, joints, and/or nervous system. When only the skin is involved, the condition is called discoid lupus. When internal organs are involved, the condition is called systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE).","2007","http://books.google.es/books?id=eIhKmRo8zPoC&pg=PA75&dq=nuclear%2Bsystemic&hl=&cd=8&source=gbs_api","160021861X",

"Detect and Deter: Can Countries Verify the Nuclear Test Ban?. Can Countries Verify the Nuclear Test Ban?","nuclear+systemic","[Jenifer Mackby, Svein Mykkeltveit, Hein Haak]","[History]","How can countries verify compliance with the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT) and detect and deter violations? It is in their interest to increase their verification readiness because the assessment of compliance with the treaty rests with states parties to the CTBT. The treaty provides countries with two verification elements: an international system of monitoring stations, and an on-site inspection regime. The monitoring system can detect nuclear explosions underground, in the atmosphere and under water. This book provides incentives to nations around the world on how they can organize their efforts to verify compliance with the CTBT and how they can collaborate with other countries, perhaps on a regional basis, to monitor areas of concern. Such focused efforts can improve their detection and deterrence capabilities through precision monitoring. The book addresses the CTBT verification from the perspective of countries. It shows how they can create the essential tools for the assessment of the large amounts of data available from the verification regime and other sources, including observations from satellites and thousands of stations outside of the treaty regime. Countries can also use current scientific and technological developments to assist them in verifying compliance with the treaty.

"Cancer and Autoimmunity","nuclear+systemic","[M.E. Gershwin, Yehuda Shoenfeld]","[Medical]","Of the two disciplines in parallel development for two decades, tumor immunology and transplantation immunology, the latter has thrived and has led to some of the most critical discoveries in immunobiology. The former continues to thwart both scientists and clinicians alike. The goal of immunologists in modern day research is to develop a simple and effective means to manipulate cancer in vivo, possibly encompassing several venues: identifying a phenotypic marker and the use of either active or passive immunization; include the use of passive reagents carrying ""warheads"" to selectively destroy cancer cells; or altering the basic process of cell survival. This excellent multidiscipline-authored volume presents a theme which has not been well described before. The papers include both basic and clinical science and range from sophisticated molecular biology to little more than phenomenology (e.g. the increased association of cancer in some autoimmune diseases and increased presentation of autoimmune phenomena in malignant condition). This, however, is state-of-the-art. This collection of themes will be of use not only to bench scientists, but also to clinicians who treat patients. The book represents progress at the cutting edge of this discipline, and points the way to further developments in the ""black box"" of immunology.","2000-03-27","http://books.google.es/books?id=FVVsXya-V3IC&pg=PA155&dq=nuclear%2Bsystemic&hl=&cd=28&source=gbs_api","9780080528458",

"The Sacred and the Sovereign. Religion and International Politics","nuclear+systemic","[John David Carlson, Erik C. Owens]","[Political Science]","Until September 11th, 2001, few in the West fully appreciated the significance of religion in international politics. The terrible events of that day refocused our attention on how thoroughly religion and politics intermingle, sometimes with horrific results. But must this intermingling always be so deadly? The Sacred and the Sovereign brings together leading voices to consider the roles that religion should -- and should not -- play in a post-Cold War age distinguished by humanitarian intervention, terrorism, globalization, and challenges to state sovereignty. But these challenges to state sovereignty have deep and abiding roots in religion that invite us to revisit just what values we hold sacred. Offsetting the commonly shared idea that religion is politics' perennial nemesis, this volume demonstrates that religious traditions, institutions, and ideas are essential elements of the political quest for human rights, peace, order, legitimacy, and justice. The Sacred and the Sovereign brings distinguished scholars of religious studies, theology, and politics together with ranking members of the military and government to reflect seriously about where -- and if -- safe boundaries can be drawn between religion and politics in the international arena.","2003","http://books.google.es/books?id=te8p7J2ROeQC&pg=PA51&dq=nuclear%2Bsystemic&hl=&cd=40&source=gbs_api","0878409084",

"The Politics of James Bond. From Fleming's Novels to the Big Screen","nuclear+bond+return","[Jeremy Black]","[Literary Criticism]","The adventures and antics of James Bond have provided the world with many of the most gripping story lines of the last half-century. Fleming?s novels were bestsellers in their day, and the Bond films have been even more popular, becoming the most enduring and successful film franchise in history. By some estimates, half of the world?s population has seen a James Bond movie. A fascinating and accessible account of this global phenomenon, The Politics of James Bond uses the plots and characterizations in the novels and the blockbuster films to place Bond in a historical, cultural, and political context. ÿ Jeremy Black charts and explores how the settings and the dynamics of the Bond adventures have changed over time in response to shifts in the real-world environment in which the fictional Bond operates. Sex, race, class, and violence are each important factors, as Agent 007 evolves from Cold War warrior to foe of SPECTRE and eventually to world defender pitted against megalomaniacal foes. The development of Bond, his leading ladies, and the major plots all shed light on world political attitudes and reflect elements of the real espionage history of the period. This analysis of Bond?s world and his lasting legacy offers an insightful look at both cultural history and popular entertainment.","2005","http://books.google.es/books?id=g4-sFrU8Xw0C&pg=PA65&dq=nuclear%2Bbond%2Breturn&hl=&cd=6&source=gbs_api","080326240X",

In this volume Simon Taylor has combined interviews with former executives, regulators and analysts with his own unique insight into the nuclear industry to provide an analysis of the origins of the crisis and the financial and corporate strategies used by British Energy plc. Arguing that the stock market was a major factor in the company's collapse by misunderstanding its finances, over-valuing the shares and giving wrong signals to management and that the government policy of trying to put all responsibility for nuclear liabilities in the hands of the private sector was neither credible nor realistic. The book concludes that failure was not inevitable but resulted from a mixture of internal and external causes that casts doubt on the policy of combining a wholly nuclear generator with liberalized power markets. This book will be of great interest to students engaged with the history of nuclear power in the UK, privatization, regulation and financial and corporate strategy, as well as experts, policy makers and strategists in the field.","2007-08-07","http://books.google.es/books?id=7ZV8AgAAQBAJ&pg=PA171&dq=nuclear%2Bbond%2Breturn&hl=&cd=9&source=gbs_api","9781134083480",

It finds that monthly deposit flows have been quite stable since the 1991 crisis; nevertheless, there have been occasions when monthly flows turned negative in the short run, coinciding with adverse domestic or external events. Econometric analysis shows that the NRI deposits are influenced by standard risk and return variables. In particular, NRI deposits respond positively to changes in relative interest rates on NRI deposits and LIBOR; negatively to political and geopolitical uncertainties, such as the government resigning in mid-term, and tensions on India's borders; and negatively to adverse external events, such as the Asian crisis.","2004-03-01","http://books.google.es/books?id=sMs2NvhwGxMC&pg=PT17&dq=nuclear%2Bbond%2Breturn&hl=&cd=17&source=gbs_api","9781452737164",

"Adolescence and Youth in Early Modern England","nuclear+bond+return","[Ilana Krausman Ben-Amos]","[Family & Relationships]","In preindustrial England, few people could expect to live past the age of forty, so adolescence and youth represented a significant proportion of an individual's life. This book by Ilana Krausman Ben-Amos is the first to explore in depth the transition from childhood to adulthood during this period, describing the maturation processes of young people from the middle and lower classes who spent their youth as apprentices, domestic servants, or agricultural servants and labourers. Previous historians of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries have assumed either that childhood was brief and there was no adolescence, or that childhood was prolonged and adolescence was maintained well into the mid-twenties. Ben-Amos argues instead that while the maturation process was prolonged in some cases, it was short and intense in others, and that variations were due to complex mental, social and economic causes. Paying close attention to differences introduced by gender and social and geographical contexts, Ben-Amos focuses on numerous aspects of youths' lives as they related to maturation. These include the separation of adolescents from their parents, their working lives, the acquisition of new skills, social relationships, religious attitudes, sexual mores and norms, and leisure activities. Drawing on urban and court records, as well as on contemporary autobiographies, Ben-Amos vividly recreates the experience of growing up in early modern England.","1994","http://books.google.es/books?id=za1aGhJdjpMC&pg=PA165&dq=nuclear%2Bbond%2Breturn&hl=&cd=25&source=gbs_api","0300055978",

In view of this grand span, ""Nobel Symposium 116"" focused on experiments and theory, and attempted to encourage interplay between them. There was emphasis on the interdisciplinary character of the subject, involving a broad range of subjects in physics, including condensed matter physics, nuclear physics, atomic physics and elementary particle physics. The physics involved in quantum chaos has much in common with acoustics, microwaves, optics, etc., and therefore the symposium also covered aspects of wave chaos in this broader sense. The program was structured according to the following areas: manifestations of classical chaos in quantum systems; transport phenomena; quantal spectra in terms of periodic orbits; semiclassical and random matrix approaches; quantum chaos in interacting systems; chaos and tunneling; and wave-dynamic chaos.

"Strategy for Chaos. Revolutions in Military Affairs and the Evidence of History","nuclear+chaotic","[Colin S. Gray]","[History]","In this volume, Professor Colin Gray develops and applies the theory and scholarship on the allegedly historical practice of the 'Revolution in Military Affairs' (RMA), in order to improve our comprehension of how and why strategy 'works'. The author explores the RMA hypothesis both theoretically and historically. The book argues that the conduct of an RMA has to be examined as a form of strategic behaviour, which means that, of necessity, it must ""work"" as strategy works. The great RMA debate of the 1990s is reviewed empathetically, though sceptically, by the author, with every major school of thought allowed its day in court. The author presents three historical RMAs as case studies for his argument: those arguably revealed in the wars of the French Revolution and Napoleon; in World War I; and in the nuclear age. The focus of his analysis is how these grand RMAs functioned strategically. The conclusions that he draws from these empirical exercises are then applied to help us understand what, indeed, is - and what is not - happening with the much vaunted information-technology-led RMA of today.","2004-03-25","http://books.google.es/books?id=M2Dwb72Nr7QC&pg=PA109&dq=nuclear%2Bchaotic&hl=&cd=25&source=gbs_api","071468483X",

"The Challenge of Abolishing Nuclear Weapons","nuclear+chaotic","[David Krieger]","[Political Science]","In the more than sixty years since the advent of nuclear weapons, there has been little meaningful progress toward nuclear disarmament. Some countries have nuclear weapons, while other states are forbidden to acquire them, a status quo that lacks rational basis and cannot be sustained. In this remarkable collection, scholars and policy analysts argue that humankind has a choice: either allow nuclear weapons to continue to proliferate throughout the world or move toward their complete elimination. The vast majority of people on the planet would surely opt to abolish nuclear weapons. But decisions about nuclear weapons are not made by the public, but by small groups of political elites. Consequently, in a world with nuclear weapons, the fate of humanity rests in the hands of a small number of individuals, whose perceptions, communications, and judgment determine whether there is to be a future. The contributors to this volume provide historical perspective on nuclear weapons policy; explore the role of international law in furthering the prospects of nuclear weapons abolition; consider the obstacles to abolition; present a path to achieving a nuclear weapons-free world; and look beyond abolition to consider issues of post-abolition sovereignty and general and complete disarmament. The goal of a nuclear weapons-free world can be awakened by an engaged citizenry bringing pressure from below in demanding action from political leaders. This book contributes to this awakening and engagement.","2011-12-31","http://books.google.es/books?id=qpQ9bT1sUXYC&pg=PA60&dq=nuclear%2Bchaotic&hl=&cd=29&source=gbs_api","1412815177",

""A fine and thoroughly up-to-date textbook on nuclear physics . . . most welcome."" -Physics Today (on the First Edition). What sets Introductory Nuclear Physics apart from other books on the subject is its presentation of nuclear physics as an integral part of modern physics. Placing the discipline within a broad historical and scientific context, it makes important connections to other fields such as elementary particle physics and astrophysics. Now fully revised and updated, this Second Edition explores the changing directions in nuclear physics, emphasizing new developments and current research-from superdeformation to quark-gluon plasma. Author Samuel S.M. Wong preserves those areas that established the First Edition as a standard text in university physics departments, focusing on what is exciting about the discipline and providing a concise, thorough, and accessible treatment of the fundamental aspects of nuclear properties. In this new edition, Professor Wong: * Includes a chapter on heavy-ion reactions-from high-spin states to quark-gluon plasma * Adds a new chapter on nuclear astrophysics * Relates observed nuclear properties to the underlying nuclear interaction and the symmetry principles governing subatomic particles * Regroups material and appendices to make the text easier to use * Lists Internet links to essential databases and research projects * Features end-of-chapter exercises using real-world data. Introductory Nuclear Physics, Second Edition is an ideal text for courses in nuclear physics at the senior undergraduate or first-year graduate level.
