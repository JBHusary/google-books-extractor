"Quantifying Systemic Risk","risk + systemic","[Joseph G. Haubrich, Andrew W. Lo]","[Business & Economics]","In the aftermath of the recent financial crisis, the federal government has pursued significant regulatory reforms, including proposals to measure and monitor systemic risk. However, there is much debate about how this might be accomplished quantitatively and objectively—or whether this is even possible. A key issue is determining the appropriate trade-offs between risk and reward from a policy and social welfare perspective given the potential negative impact of crises. One of the first books to address the challenges of measuring statistical risk from a system-wide persepective, Quantifying Systemic Risk looks at the means of measuring systemic risk and explores alternative approaches. Among the topics discussed are the challenges of tying regulations to specific quantitative measures, the effects of learning and adaptation on the evolution of the market, and the distinction between the shocks that start a crisis and the mechanisms that enable it to grow.","2013-01-24","http://books.google.es/books?id=cemEjRqwXFwC&printsec=frontcover&dq=risk+%2B+systemic&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api","0226921964",

"Systemic Risk and Optimal Regulatory Architecture","risk + systemic","[Juan Sole, Marco A. Espinosa-Vega, Charles M. Kahn, Rafael Matta]","[Business & Economics]","Until the recent financial crisis, the safety and soundness of financial institutions was assessed from the perspective of the individual institution. the financial crisis highlighted the need to take systemic externalities seriously when rethinking prudential oversight and the regulatory architecture. Current financial reform legislation worldwide reflects this intent. However, these reforms have overlooked the need to also consider regulatory agencies' forbearance and information sharing incentives. In a political economy model that explicitly accounts for systemic connectedness, and regulators' incentives, we show that under an expanded mandate to explicitly oversee systemic risk, regulators would be more forbearing towards systemically important institutions. We also show that when some regulators have access to information regarding an institutions' degree of systemic importance, these regulators may have little incentive to gather and share it with other regulators. These findings suggest that (and we show conditions under which) a unified regulatory arrangement can reduce the degree of systemic risk vis--vis a multiple regulatory arrangement.","2011-08-01","http://books.google.es/books?id=NoYsp_o_YTcC&printsec=frontcover&dq=risk+%2B+systemic&hl=&cd=3&source=gbs_api","1463900775",
"Bank Runs and Systemic Risk","risk + systemic","[Edwin H. Neave]","[Business & Economics]","This chapter examines performance and stability issues associated with bank operations. It first shows how bank portfolio structures pose a trade-off for both bank and system stability.

Finally, the chapter considers how system risks differ from the risk of individual bank operations, and sketches policies for dealing with them.","2010-12-16","http://books.google.es/books?id=bCe6zrIcvcwC&printsec=frontcover&dq=risk+%2B+systemic&hl=&cd=4&source=gbs_api","9780470944790",
"Engineering the Financial Crisis. Systemic Risk and the Failure of Regulation","risk + systemic","[Jeffrey Friedman, Wladimir Kraus]","[Business & Economics]","The financial crisis has been blamed on reckless bankers, irrational exuberance, government support of mortgages for the poor, financial deregulation, and expansionary monetary policy. Specialists in banking, however, tell a story with less emotional resonance but a better correspondence to the evidence: the crisis was sparked by the international regulatory accords on bank capital levels, the Basel Accords. In one of the first studies critically to examine the Basel Accords, Engineering the Financial Crisis reveals the crucial role that bank capital requirements and other government regulations played in the recent financial crisis. Jeffrey Friedman and Wladimir Kraus argue that by encouraging banks to invest in highly rated mortgage-backed bonds, the Basel Accords created an overconcentration of risk in the banking industry. In addition, accounting regulations required banks to reduce lending if the temporary market value of these bonds declined, as they did in 2007 and 2008 during the panic over subprime mortgage defaults. The book begins by assessing leading theories about the crisis—deregulation, bank compensation practices, excessive leverage, ""too big to fail,"" and Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac—and, through careful evidentiary scrutiny, debunks much of the conventional wisdom about what went wrong. It then discusses the Basel Accords and how they contributed to systemic risk. Finally, it presents an analysis of social-science expertise and the fallibility of economists and regulators. Engagingly written, theoretically inventive, yet empirically grounded, Engineering the Financial Crisis is a timely examination of the unintended—and sometimes disastrous—effects of regulation on complex economies.","2011-09-01","http://books.google.es/books?id=73EUJAMpfxYC&printsec=frontcover&dq=risk+%2B+systemic&hl=&cd=5&source=gbs_api","9780812205077",

Recent events suggest that older models of systemic shocks might no longer capture all of the possible paths of such disturbances or account for the increasing complexity of the financial system. To help assess these concerns, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and the NRC cosponsored a conference that brought together engineers, scientists, economists, and financial market experts to promote better understanding of systemic risk in a variety of fields. The book presents an examination of tools used in ecology and engineering to study systemic collapse in those areas; a review of current trends in economic research on systemic risk, the payments system, and the market of interbank funds; and for context, descriptions of how systemic risk in the financial system affects trading activities.","2007-12-31","http://books.google.es/books?id=1jGlL5OFf2oC&printsec=frontcover&dq=risk+%2B+systemic&hl=&cd=9&source=gbs_api","030917953X",
"Technical Capabilities Necessary for Systemic Risk Regulation. Summary of a Workshop","risk + systemic","[Board on Mathematical Sciences and Their Applications, Division on Engineering and Physical Sciences, National Research Council]","[Business & Economics]","The financial reform plans currently under discussion in the United States recognize the need for monitoring and regulating systemic risk in the financial sector. To inform those discussions, the National Research Council held a workshop on November 3, 2009, to identify the major technical challenges to building such a capability. The workshop, summarized in this volume, addressed the following key issues as they relate to systemic risk: What data and analytical tools are currently available to regulators to address this challenge? What further data-collection and data-analysis capabilities are needed? What specific resource needs are required to accomplish the task? What are the major technical challenges associated with systemic risk regulation? What are various options for building these capabilities? Because every systemic event is unique with respect to its specific pathology--the various triggers and the propagation of effects--the workshop focused on the issues listed above for systemic risk in general rather than for any specific scenario. Thus, by design, the workshop explicitly addressed neither the causes of the current crisis nor policy options for reducing risk, and it attempted to steer clear of some policy issues altogether (such as how to allocate new supervisory responsibilities). More than 40 experts representing diverse perspectives participated in the workshop.","2010-02-08","http://books.google.es/books?id=7So2FzT5spwC&printsec=frontcover&dq=risk+%2B+systemic&hl=&cd=10&source=gbs_api","9780309150521",
"Market Discipline Under Systemic Risk. Evidence from Bank Runs in Emerging Economies","risk + systemic","[Eduardo Levy Yeyati, Maria Soledad Martinez Peria, Sergio L. Schmukler]","[Bank failures]","""Levy-Yeyati, Martinez Peria, and Schmukler show that systemic risk exerts a significant impact on the behavior of depositors, sometimes overshadowing their responses to standard bank fundamentals. Systemic risk can affect market discipline both regardless of and through bank fundamentals. First, worsening systemic conditions can directly threaten the value of deposits by way of dual agency problems. Second, to the extent that banks are exposed to systemic risk, systemic shocks lead to a future deterioration of fundamentals not captured by their current values. Using data from the recent banking crises in Argentina and Uruguay, the authors show that market discipline is indeed quite robust once systemic risk is factored in. As systemic risk increases, the informational content of past fundamentals declines. These episodes also show how few systemic shocks can trigger a run irrespective of ex-ante fundamentals. Overall, the evidence suggests that in emerging economies, the notion of market discipline needs to account for systemic risk.

We find a positive trend in stock return correlations net of diversification effects for a sample of U.S. Large and Complex Banking Organizations over 1988-99. This finding suggests that the systemic risk potential in the financial sector may have increased. In addition, we find a positive consolidation elasticity of correlations. However, such elasticity exhibits substantial time variation and likely declined in the latter part of the decade. Thus, factors other than consolidation have also been responsible for the upward trend in return correlations.","2002-03-01","http://books.google.es/books?id=hBwTkJ0bruMC&pg=PA4&dq=risk+%2B+systemic&hl=&cd=12&source=gbs_api","Systemic Risk and F",

"Uncontrolled Risk: Lessons of Lehman Brothers and How Systemic Risk Can Still Bring Down the World Financial System","risk + systemic","[Mark Williams]","[Business & Economics]","How Excessive Risk Destroyed Lehman and Nearly Brought Down the Financial Industry “Uncontrolled Risk will ruffle feathers—and for good reason—as voters and legislators learn the diffi cult lessons of Lehman’s collapse and demand that we never forget them.” Dr. David C. Shimko, Board of Trustees, Global Association of Risk Professionals “Uncontrolled Risk is a drama as gripping as any work of fiction. Williams’s recommendations for changes in the governance of financial institutions should be of interest to anyone concerned about the welfare of global financial markets.” Geoffrey Miller, Stuyvesant Comfort Professor of Law and Director, Center for the Study of Central Banks and Financial Institutions, New York University “The complex balance of free enterprise on Wall Street and the healthy regulation of its participants is the central economic issue of today. Williams’s forensic study of Lehman’s collapse may be the best perspective so far on the issues that now face regulators.” Jeffrey P. Davis, CFA, Chief Investment Officer, Lee Munder Capital Group “Provides a very perceptive analysis of the fl aws inherent in risk management systems and modern fi nancial markets. Mandatory reading for risk managers and financial industry executives.” Vincent Kaminski, Professor in the Practice of Management, Jesse H. Jones Graduate School of Business, Rice University “Gives the reader much food for thought on the regulation of our financial system and its interplay with corporate governance reform in the United States and around the world.” Professor Charles M. Elson, Edgar S. Woolard Jr. Chair in Corporate Governance, University of Delaware The risk taking behind Wall Street's largest bankruptcy . . . In this dramatic and compelling account of Lehman Brothers’ spectacular rise and fall, author Mark T. Williams explains how uncontrolled risk toppled a 158-year-old institution—and what it says about Wall Street, Washington, D.C., and the world financial system. A former trading floor executive and Fed bank examiner, Williams sees Lehman’s 2008 collapse as a microcosm of the industry—a worst-case scenario of smart decisions, stupid mistakes, ignored warnings, and important lessons in money, power, and policy that affect us all. This book reveals: The Congressional inquisition of disgraced CEO Dick Fuld: Did he really deserve it? How the investment-banking money machine broke down: Can it be fixed? The key drivers that caused the financial meltdown: Can lessons be learned from them? The wild risk taking denounced by President Obama: Is Washington to blame, too? The ongoing debate on reform and regulation: Can meaningful reform avert another financial catastrophe? This fascinating account traces Lehman’s history from its humble beginnings in 1850 to its collapse in 2008. Lehman’s story exemplifies the everchanging trends in finance—from investment vehicles to federal policies—and exposes the danger and infectious nature of uncontrolled risk. Drawing upon first-person interviews with risk management experts and former Lehman employees, Williams provides more than just a frontline report: it’s a call to action for Wall Street bankers, Washington policymakers, and U.S. citizens—a living lesson in risk management on which to build a stronger fi nancial future. Williams provides a tenpoint plan to implement today—so another Lehman doesn’t collapse tomorrow.

"Australia: Addressing Systemic Risk Through Higher Loss Absorbency Technical Note","risk + systemic","[International Monetary Fund]","[Business & Economics]","Australia s four largest banks can be considered domestically systemic. They make up the lion s share of the banking system, use similar business models, and are interconnected. The top four banks are relatively similar in terms of systemic importance, partly reflecting the authorities ?four pillar? policy, which aims at preventing the number of large banks from falling below four. To deal with systemic risks, the authorities deploy a multi-pronged approach consisting of risk-based supervision, recovery and resolution planning, and conservative risk weights and definitions of loss absorbent capital. Most countries that have already identified strategies to deal with their systemic institutions incorporate higher loss absorbency for systemic institutions in their approach. Market based methodologies using the expected default frequency for systemic institutions can gauge the amount of additional capital higher loss absorbency required to reduce the probability of failure of systemic institutions to an acceptable level. Alternatively, the implied funding cost advantage can indicate the degree of systemic importance and be used to define higher capital requirements to offset this implicit subsidy. Application of these methods to Australian banks provides a range of estimates of higher loss absorbency requirements for systemic institutions and a transparent framework for discussion and selection of these requirements.","2012-11-21","http://books.google.es/books?id=M9eXpZT4NrgC&printsec=frontcover&dq=risk+%2B+systemic&hl=&cd=22&source=gbs_api","9781475522273",

"Measuring Systemic Liquidity Risk and the Cost of Liquidity Insurance","risk + systemic","[Tiago Severo]","[Business & Economics]","I construct a systemic liquidity risk index (SLRI) from data on violations of arbitrage relationships across several asset classes between 2004 and 2010. Then I test whether the equity returns of 53 global banks were exposed to this liquidity risk factor. Results show that the level of bank returns is not directly affected by the SLRI, but their volatility increases when liquidity conditions deteriorate. I do not find a strong association between bank size and exposure to the SLRI - measured as the sensitivity of volatility to the index. Surprisingly, exposure to systemic liquidity risk is positively associated with the Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR). The link between equity volatility and the SLRI allows me to calculate the cost that would be borne by public authorities for providing liquidity support to the financial sector. I use this information to estimate a liquidity insurance premium that could be paid by individual banks in order to cover for that social cost.","2012-07-01","http://books.google.es/books?id=55WI6eORGhkC&printsec=frontcover&dq=risk+%2B+systemic&hl=&cd=26&source=gbs_api","9781475569414",

Several risk factors are identified and it is hereby shown that the level of systemic risk contains a predictable component which varies through time. Furthermore, it is shown how the systemic risk forecasts map into crisis signals and how policy thresholds are derived in this framework.

"Systemic Liquidity Risk and Bipolar Markets. Wealth Management in Today's Macro Risk On / Risk Off Financial Environment","risk + systemic","[Clive M. Corcoran]","[Business & Economics]","The dramatic and well chronicled crisis of 2007/8 marked a watershed moment for all stakeholders in global capital markets. In the aftermath, financial markets have become even more tightly coupled as correlations in returns across multiple asset classes have been at historically elevated levels. Investors and fund managers are, to a much larger degree than previously and often much more than they realize, subject to the risk of severe wealth destruction. The ultimate hazard, which is not adequately characterized by the widely touted notion of tail risk, is the systemic risk which arises when liquidity in markets completely evaporates. Not only did this happen in the second half of 2008, but it has been repeated episodically since then – most notably in May 2010, in an incident known as the Flash Crash, and in the fall of 2011 when correlations were at historically elevated levels. Conventional asset allocation tools and techniques have failed to keep apace with the changing financial landscape which has emerged since 2008. In addition to the preponderance of algorithmic trading and the associated changes in the liquidity characteristics of financial markets, a new paradigm of risk on/risk off asset allocation has emerged. Risk on/risk off is a widely adopted style of trading and macro allocation strategy where positions are taken in several closely aligned asset classes depending on the prevailing sentiment or appetite for risk. The consequences of the day to day (and intraday) switching between either a risk on or risk off tactical strategies poses significant new challenges to investors who are still making investment decisions with outmoded notions from traditional asset allocation theory. How can one cushion the impact of systemically threatening events when the ability to exit financial instruments becomes almost non existent? How can one trust the integrity of financial models and orthodox macro financial theory which have become increasingly discredited? Can central bankers be relied upon to become the counter-parties of last resort and provide a safety net under the financial system? These vital questions, and many others, need to be addressed by everyone who has a stake in modern financial markets, and they are addressed in Systemic Liquidity Risk and Bipolar Markets. Proper functioning markets require fractiousness or divided opinion, and this needs to be lubricated by communications from central bankers, economic forecasters, corporate executives and so on. As long as such messages and market conditions remain ambiguous, providing asymmetric information to different market players, then the conditions are present to enable systemic liquidity to be preserved. Seen in this context the prevailing paradigm of bipolar risk on/risk off asset allocations is both a prerequisite to liquid markets, and also paradoxically, when one side of the polarity becomes too extreme, a major source of systemic instability. Should such polarities become critically unbalanced, and should the signals received by market players become symmetrically disadvantageous as they were in the fall of 2008, then an even more substantial systemic liquidity crisis than that seen in those troubled times is a dangerous possibility. Apart from the practical risk management tools and tactics that are recommended in Systemic Liquidity Risk and Bipolar Markets, there is a provocative and cogent narrative to provide anxious and perplexed investors with a coherent explanation of the post GFC financial environment, and which should assist them in navigating the choppy waters ahead.","2012-11-26","http://books.google.es/books?id=Xa68Z0He1tYC&pg=PA296&dq=risk+%2B+systemic&hl=&cd=29&source=gbs_api","9781118410752",

"Collateral, Netting and Systemic Risk in the Otc Derivatives Market","risk + systemic","[Manmohan Singh]","[Business & Economics]","To mitigate systemic risk, some regulators have advocated the greater use of centralized counterparties (CCPs) to clear Over-The-Counter (OTC) derivatives trades. Regulators should be cognizant that large banks active in the OTC derivatives market do not hold collateral against all the positions in their trading book and the paper proves an estimate of this under-collateralization. Whatever collateral is held by banks is allowed to be rehypothecated (or re-used) to others. Since CCPs would require all positions to have collateral against them, off-loading a significant portion of OTC derivatives transactions to central counterparties (CCPs) would require large increases in posted collateral, possibly requiring large banks to raise more capital. These costs suggest that most large banks will be reluctant to offload their positions to CCPs, and the paper proposes an appropriate capital levy on remaining positions to encourage the transition.","2010-04-01","http://books.google.es/books?id=10JrdHH3XBAC&printsec=frontcover&dq=risk+%2B+systemic&hl=&cd=32&source=gbs_api","9781451982855",

Historically, government insurance programs tend to be ineffective at segregating risks, leading to markets that are inefficient. In the case of the Federal Crop Insurance program, rates are set non-competitively. This study develops a spatial econometric model of loss experience and finds evidence of geographic misratings. The results also suggest that substantial actuarial cross-subsidization is resulting from the apparent rating inequities, which has a variety of welfare implications.","2008","http://books.google.es/books?id=Z8RtXAt5Y24C&printsec=frontcover&dq=risk+%2B+systemic&hl=&cd=34&source=gbs_api","0549911456",

"Systemic Risk and Asymmetric Responses in the Financial Industry (EPub)","risk + systemic","[Mr. Germán López-Espinosa, Mr. Antonio Rubia, Miss Laura Valderrama, Mr. Antonio Moreno]","[Business & Economics]","To date, an operational measure of systemic risk capturing non-linear tail comovement between system-wide and individual bank returns has not yet been developed. This paper proposes an extension of the so-called CoVaR measure that captures the asymmetric response of the banking system to positive and negative shocks to the market-valued balance sheets of individual banks. For the median of our sample of U.S. banks, the relative impact on the system of a fall in individual market value is sevenfold that of an increase. Moreover, the downward bias in systemic risk from ignoring this asymmetric pattern increases with bank size. The conditional tail comovement between the banking system and a top decile bank which is losing market value is 5.4 larger than the unconditional tail comovement versus only 2.2 for banks in the bottom decile. The asymmetric model also produces much better estimates and fitting, and thus improves the capacity to monitor systemic risk. Our results suggest that ignoring asymmetries in tail interdependence may lead to a severe underestimation of systemic risk in a downward market.","2012-06-01","http://books.google.es/books?id=kcor6jcjvgUC&pg=PT4&dq=risk+%2B+systemic&hl=&cd=37&source=gbs_api","9781475517569",

This framework is implemented using large sets of quarterly time series of indicators of financial and real activity for the G-7 economies for the 1980Q1-2009Q3 period. We obtain two main results. First, there is evidence of out-of sample forecasting power for tail risk realizations of real activity for several countries, suggesting the usefulness of the model as a risk monitoring tool. Second, in all countries aggregate demand shocks are the main drivers of the real cycle, and bank credit demand shocks are the main drivers of the bank lending cycle. These results challenge the common wisdom that constraints in the aggregate supply of credit have been a key driver of the sharp downturn in real activity experienced by the G-7 economies in 2008Q4- 2009Q1.","2010-02-01","http://books.google.es/books?id=2J3GZ741etYC&pg=PT10&dq=risk+%2B+systemic&hl=&cd=39&source=gbs_api","9781452778303",

"Leveraged Buyouts (LBO) in private equity deals. Deal structure, risk structure and governance implications in LBO transactions","risk + structure",,"[Business & Economics]","Igniting in 2005, the discussion about highly leveraged transactions conducted by financial institutions became a matter of great controversy in German politics as well as in the media. Fuelled by an influential voice in politics, LBO firms became the face of capitalism’s evil by calling them a “Heuschrecke”, an animal much feared in history for its exploitive behaviour and risks to the mediaeval agrarian economy (Die Zeit, 2005). In terms of today’s Heuschrecke, according to public voice, downsizing and raiding represent the major risks attributed. Empirics show that the risk of downsizing in LBOs is falsified and that the occurrence of raids is rather irrelevant in today’s buyout universe. However, even if both risks held, each would exhibit a comparably low impact on the economy as a whole. Contrary, the empirically evident high-impact risk of over-indebtedness in leveraged transactions is widely neglected. The negligence of this risk-issue is dangerous, particularly with regard to the recent developments in the LBO industry, debt capital markets and the world’s economy. First, analysing the latest LBOs conducted, it appears that the historical failures, such as the buyouts of Revco and RJR Narbisco are widely forgotten, as gearing ratios have become aggressive again. Second, the subprime crisis, which was exported from the US real estate sector into global capital markets, caused liquidity shortages – AA rated banks were not willing to lend money to their equally rated peers anymore – which led to a credit crisis. This credit crunch provoked that, even though in the US the prime rate has been reduced by 50 bp, and in the Eurozone the prime rate was not increased as planed, ‘money became expensive’; FIBOR, LIBOR and EURIBOR sharply increased and remained high. This resulted in high debt funding costs. Third, taking a look at the world economy, America might face an economic downturn in the near future with decreasing consumption and increasing inflation. Each of the three aspects alone increases the default risk in a highly leveraged firm. In a scenario where all three jointly appear, the probability of default sharply increases. In addition to the risk named, the threat an LBO imposes on global debt capital markets is evident, therefore, it can not be ignored any longer in Europe. While it was already heavily discussed in America’s late 80s buyout-boom, it slowly gains prominence in discussions about LBO transactions.","2008-05-08","http://books.google.es/books?id=z41e2EFK0sUC&printsec=frontcover&dq=risk+%2B+structure&hl=&cd=3&source=gbs_api","9783638044547",

Subsidiary-based corporate structures benefit from greater protection against economic risk because of affiliate-level limited liability, but are more exposed to the risk of capital expropriation than are branches. Thus, branch-based structures are preferred to subsidiary-based structures when expropriation risk is high relative to economic risk, and vice versa. Greater cross-country risk correlation and more accurate pricing of risk by investors reduce the differences between the two structures. Furthermore, the corporate structure affects bank risk taking and affiliate size.","2010-02-01","http://books.google.es/books?id=YvJkMnQqXtEC&pg=PA4&dq=risk+%2B+structure&hl=&cd=7&source=gbs_api","9781451918854",

This book provides an introduction and overview for readers who seek an up-to-date reference to the central problems of the field and to the tools currently used to analyze them. The book is aimed at researchers and students in finance, at quantitative analysts in banks and other financial institutions, and at regulators interested in the modeling aspects of credit risk. David Lando considers the two broad approaches to credit risk analysis: that based on classical option pricing models on the one hand, and on a direct modeling of the default probability of issuers on the other. He offers insights that can be drawn from each approach and demonstrates that the distinction between the two approaches is not at all clear-cut. The book strikes a fruitful balance between quickly presenting the basic ideas of the models and offering enough detail so readers can derive and implement the models themselves. The discussion of the models and their limitations and five technical appendixes help readers expand and generalize the models themselves or to understand existing generalizations. The book emphasizes models for pricing as well as statistical techniques for estimating their parameters. Applications include rating-based modeling, modeling of dependent defaults, swap- and corporate-yield curve dynamics, credit default swaps, and collateralized debt obligations.","2009-12-13","http://books.google.es/books?id=bbaTr3bb110C&pg=RA1-PA12&dq=risk+%2B+structure&hl=&cd=11&source=gbs_api","9781400829194",

Van Deventer, Kenji Imai, Mark Mesler]","[Business & Economics]","Practical tools and advice for managing financial risk, updated for a post-crisis world Advanced Financial Risk Management bridges the gap between the idealized assumptions used for risk valuation and the realities that must be reflected in management actions. It explains, in detailed yet easy-to-understand terms, the analytics of these issues from A to Z, and lays out a comprehensive strategy for risk management measurement, objectives, and hedging techniques that apply to all types of institutions. Written by experienced risk managers, the book covers everything from the basics of present value, forward rates, and interest rate compounding to the wide variety of alternative term structure models. Revised and updated with lessons from the 2007-2010 financial crisis, Advanced Financial Risk Management outlines a framework for fully integrated risk management. Credit risk, market risk, asset and liability management, and performance measurement have historically been thought of as separate disciplines, but recent developments in financial theory and computer science now allow these views of risk to be analyzed on a more integrated basis. The book presents a performance measurement approach that goes far beyond traditional capital allocation techniques to measure risk-adjusted shareholder value creation, and supplements this strategic view of integrated risk with step-by-step tools and techniques for constructing a risk management system that achieves these objectives. Practical tools for managing risk in the financial world Updated to include the most recent events that have influenced risk management Topics covered include the basics of present value, forward rates, and interest rate compounding; American vs. European fixed income options; default probability models; prepayment models; mortality models; and alternatives to the Vasicek model Comprehensive and in-depth, Advanced Financial Risk Management is an essential resource for anyone working in the financial field.","2013-02-05","http://books.google.es/books?id=N8fZB7a2O2cC&pg=PA815&dq=risk+%2B+structure&hl=&cd=22&source=gbs_api","9781118278574",

"Pricing, Risk, and Performance Measurement in Practice. The Building Block Approach to Modeling Instruments and Portfolios","risk + structure","[Wolfgang Schwerdt, Marcelle von Wendland]","[Business & Economics]","How can managers increase their ability to calculate price and risk data for financial instruments while decreasing their dependence on a myriad of specific instrument variants? Wolfgang Schwerdt and Marcelle von Wendland created a simple and consistent way to handle and process large amounts of complex financial data. By means of a practical framework, their approach analyzes market and credit risk exposure of financial instruments and portfolios and calculates risk adjusted performance measures. Its emphasis on standardization yields significant improvements in speed and accuracy. Schwerdt and von Wendland's focus on practical implementation directly addresses limitations imposed by the complex and costly processing time required for advanced risk management models and pricing hundreds of thousands of securities each day. Their many examples and programming codes demonstrate how to use standards to build financial instruments, how to price them, and how to measure the risk and performance of the portfolios that include them. Feature: The authors have designed and implemented a standard for the description of financial instruments Benefit: The reader can rely on accurate and valid information about describing financial instruments Feature: The authors have developed an approach for pricing and analyzing any financial instrument using a limited set of atomic instruments Benefit: The reader can use these instruments to define and set up even very large numbers of financial instruments.

"Crime, Risk and Justice. The Politics of Crime Control in Liberal Democracies","risk + structure","[Kevin Stenson, Robert R. Sullivan]","[Social Science]","From being a relatively marginal political issue, crime control has risen rapidly up the social and political agendas of western societies. As inequalities have increased, so the actual and perceived risks of crime and other social ills have grown rapidly for all sections of society: the management of risk has become a central concern. In response, the state has increasingly devolved responsibility for personal security onto individuals, resulting in an explosion of private security arrangements related to the home, the person and personal property. At the same time the state has addressed itself in increasingly draconian fashion to more serious crime: retributive sentencing has grown even harsher. This book addresses a range of themes arising from these developments. An eminent cast of criminologists from Britain, the USA and Australia explores the links between crime and risk -- from the depiction of crime in the media to the dilemmas of policing, from the new punitiveness of criminal justice systems to the custodial warehousing of the poor and excluded. A central connecting theme of the book is that crime control can no longer be viewed as a technical operation of law enforcement and adjudication; rather it has become a central feature of the increasingly pluralised and complex government of liberal societies.v","2001","http://books.google.es/books?id=gp2UJl88PJ8C&pg=PA56&dq=risk+%2B+structure&hl=&cd=32&source=gbs_api","9781903240397",

"German Banking Structure, Pricing and Competition. Implications and International Policy Perspectives","risk + structure","[Benjamin H. Dietrich]","[Business & Economics]","The German banking system is characterized by high fragmentation, low profitability and low foreign ownership. Main reason for this is its particular structure that can best be described as forced segmentation. This structure produces local banking markets. The book argues that local bank competition is not as pronounced as national concentration ratios predict and presents a bank pricing study which indicates that local banks, banks located in less densely populated areas and less productive banks tend to charge higher prices for retail bank services than banks that operate nationally. These results as well as lessons drawn from international reforms suggest that the German banking system could benefit from cross-pillar consolidation which promises to export competition from the national to local banking markets. Last but not least, the book analyzes political economy implications of banking reforms and provides suggestions on status quo resolution by identifying ways to facilitate reform implementation in the German banking system.","2009","http://books.google.es/books?id=VxA0mpv6DTYC&pg=PA59&dq=risk+%2B+structure&hl=&cd=35&source=gbs_api","3631590229",
"Bank Ownership, Market Structure and Risk","risk + structure","[De Nicol&#x00F3, Gianni De Nicol, , Gianni, Elena Loukoianova]","[Business & Economics]","This paper presents a model of a banking industry with heterogeneous banks that delivers predictions on the relationship between banks' risk of failure, market structure, bank ownership, and banks' screening and bankruptcy costs. These predictions are explored empirically using a panel of individual banks data and ownership information including more than 10,000 bank-year observations for 133 non-industrialized countries during the 1993-2004 period. Four main results obtain. First, the positive and significant relationship between bank concentration and bank risk of failure found in Boyd, De Nicol and Al Jalal (2006) is stronger when bank ownership is taken into account, and it is strongest when state-owned banks have sizeable market shares. Second, conditional on country and firm specific characteristics, the risk profiles of foreign (state-owned) banks are significantly higher than (not significantly different from) those of private domestic banks. Third, private domestic banks do take on more risk as a result of larger market shares of both state-owned and foreign banks. Fourth, the model rationalizes this evidence if both state-owned and foreign banks have either larger screening and/or lower bankruptcy costs than private domestic banks, banks' differences in market shares, screening or bankruptcy costs are not too large, and loan markets are sufficiently segmented across banks of different ownership.","2007-09-01","http://books.google.es/books?id=_8WMdXme1kYC&pg=PA3&dq=risk+%2B+structure&hl=&cd=36&source=gbs_api","9781451912326",
"Modeling Infectious Diseases in Humans and Animals","risk + structure","[Matt J. Keeling, Pejman Rohani]","[Science]","For epidemiologists, evolutionary biologists, and health-care professionals, real-time and predictive modeling of infectious disease is of growing importance. This book provides a timely and comprehensive introduction to the modeling of infectious diseases in humans and animals, focusing on recent developments as well as more traditional approaches. Matt Keeling and Pejman Rohani move from modeling with simple differential equations to more recent, complex models, where spatial structure, seasonal ""forcing,"" or stochasticity influence the dynamics, and where computer simulation needs to be used to generate theory. In each of the eight chapters, they deal with a specific modeling approach or set of techniques designed to capture a particular biological factor. They illustrate the methodology used with examples from recent research literature on human and infectious disease modeling, showing how such techniques can be used in practice. Diseases considered include BSE, foot-and-mouth, HIV, measles, rubella, smallpox, and West Nile virus, among others. Particular attention is given throughout the book to the development of practical models, useful both as predictive tools and as a means to understand fundamental epidemiological processes. To emphasize this approach, the last chapter is dedicated to modeling and understanding the control of diseases through vaccination, quarantine, or culling. Comprehensive, practical introduction to infectious disease modeling Builds from simple to complex predictive models Models and methodology fully supported by examples drawn from research literature Practical models aid students' understanding of fundamental epidemiological processes For many of the models presented, the authors provide accompanying programs written in Java, C, Fortran, and MATLAB In-depth treatment of role of modeling in understanding disease control","2011-09-19","http://books.google.es/books?id=LxzILSuKDhUC&pg=PT104&dq=risk+%2B+structure&hl=&cd=37&source=gbs_api","9781400841035",

Furthermore extensive introductions are given to credibility theory and ordering of risks. The book reflects the state of the art in actuarial risk theory. In addition to some chapters which are compatible with official material of actuarial education in North-America, Europe and other parts of the world, the book contains important material on topics that are relevant for recent insurance and actuarial developments including determining solvency measures, fair-value computations, reserving, ranking of risks, modelling dependencies and the use of generalized linear models. Basic ideas on risk measures in the framework of insurance premiums are also considered. The numerous exercises contained in Modern Actuarial Risk Theory, together with the hints for solving the more difficult ones and the numerical answers to many others, make the book useful as a textbook. Some important practical paradigms in insurance are presented in a way that is appealing to actuaries in their daily business.

The results show that banks with weaker structural liquidity and higher leverage in the pre-crisis period were more likely to fail afterward. The likelihood of bank failure also increases with bank risk-taking. In the cross-section, the smaller domestically-oriented banks were relatively more vulnerable to liquidity risk, while the large cross-border banks were more susceptible to solvency risk due to excessive leverage. The results support the proposed Basel III regulations on structural liquidity and leverage, but suggest that emphasis should be placed on the latter, particularly for the systemically-important institutions. Macroeconomic and monetary conditions are also shown to be related with the likelihood of bank failure, providing a case for the introduction of a macro-prudential approach to banking regulation.","2012-01-01","http://books.google.es/books?id=PEFkuYAdcuUC&printsec=frontcover&dq=risk+%2B+structures&hl=&cd=2&source=gbs_api","9781463949525",

"Construction Management and Design of Industrial Concrete and Steel Structures","risk + structures","[Mohamed A. El-Reedy]","[Technology & Engineering]","The recent worldwide boom in industrial construction and the corresponding billions of dollars spent every year in industrial, oil, gas, and petrochemical and power generation project, has created fierce competition for these projects. Strong management and technical competence will bring your projects in on time and on budget. An in-depth exploration of both these aspects and the resulting challenges, Construction Management and Design of Industrial Concrete and Steel Structures provides a practical guide to the design of reinforced concrete and steel structures and foundations in industrial projects. Renowned expert Mohamed A. El-Reedy covers the entire industrial construction process, from project management to design and construction to sigh off and providing a maintenance plan. Highlighting the differences between industrial construction and real estate or residential construction, he examines every phase and every role, from managerial to technical. He includes cases from industrial projects and covers the international technical practices, codes, and standards used in steel or concrete onshore or offshore projects. The book provides up-to-date methodologies in structure analysis, geotechnical studies, and international special codes and standards for industrial structures such as tanks, foundation under towers, machines, and special structures in industrial projects. It also examines the safety and economic benefits of developing a structure integrity management system. When a project has a budget that seems as huge at the structure itself, the client, engineering firm, and contractor must work together to achieve success. Discussing the interface between these three main partners, this book outlines strategies for checking the design and controlling a project in all its phases.","2010-09-30","http://books.google.es/books?id=8L6a5FM-oeoC&pg=PA449&dq=risk+%2B+structures&hl=&cd=17&source=gbs_api","9781439816004",
"Steel-Reinforced Concrete Structures. Assessment and Repair of Corrosion","risk + structures","[Mohamed El-Reedy]","[Technology & Engineering]","A Practical Guide to Maintenance Carrying a billion-dollar price tag, corrosion of reinforced concrete is the enemy of every country’s investment in real estate. The widespread and long-term use of reinforced concrete makes its correct and proper examination, maintenance, and repair paramount. Steel-Reinforced Concrete Structures: Assessment and Repair of Corrosion explains the corrosion of reinforced concrete from a practical point of view, highlighting protective design and repair procedures. The book begins with a discussion of the corrosion phenomena, the effect of concrete properties on corrosion, and the precautions available in the construction stage to mitigate corrosion. It covers the theoretical and practical methods in evaluating the concrete structures and new, practical methods to protect steel reinforcement. The book also includes methods established in the last decade that provide new ways of protecting steel-reinforced bars and the traditional and advanced repairing methods. The author explains the importance of implementing an integrity management system to provide a comprehensive maintenance strategy and concludes with coverage of the traditional, time-tested, and advanced repair techniques. A special feature is a chapter focusing on the advance maintenance plan philosophy and risk-based maintenance for reinforced concrete structures. The author examines economic analysis procedures and the probability of structural failures to define structure risk assessment. He covers precautions and recommendations for protecting the reinforced concrete structures from corrosion based on codes and specifications. He uses case histories from all over the world to demonstrate the widespread application and range of advanced repair techniques and presents a practical guide to the maintenance of concrete structures. The book provides procedures for corrosion diagnosis and determining the appropriate methods for repair, as well as economic models for on-site decision making.","2010-12-12","http://books.google.es/books?id=IVn8q-yUln8C&pg=PA193&dq=risk+%2B+structures&hl=&cd=18&source=gbs_api","9781420054316",

"Essays on Corporate Risk Governance","risk + structures","[Mr. Gaizka Ormazabal Sanchez]",,"This dissertation comprises three papers on the governance of corporate risk: 1. The first paper investigates the role of organizational structures aimed at monitoring corporate risk. Proponents of risk-related governance structures, such as risk committees or Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) programs, assert that risk monitoring adds value by ensuring that corporate risks are managed. An alternative view is that such governance structures are nothing more than window-dressing created in response to regulatory or public pressure. Consistent with the former view, I find that, in the period between 2000 and 2006, firms with more observable risk oversight structures exhibit lower equity and credit risk than firms with fewer or no observable risk oversight structures. I also provide evidence that firms with more observable risk oversight structures experienced higher returns during the worst days of the 2007-2008 financial crisis and were less susceptible to market fluctuations than firms with fewer or no observable risk oversight structures. Finally, I find that firms without observable risk oversight structures experienced higher abnormal returns to recent legislative events relating to risk management than firms with observable risk oversight structures. 2. The most common empirical measure of managerial risk-taking incentives is equity portfolio vega (Vega), which is measured as the dollar change in a manager's equity portfolio for a 0.01 change in the standard deviation of stock returns. However, Vega exhibits at least three undesirable features. First, Vega is expressed as a dollar change. This implicitly assumes that managers with identical Vega have the same incentives regardless of differences in their total equity and other wealth. Second, the small change in the standard deviation of returns used to calculate Vega (i.e., 0.01) yields a very local approximation of managerial risk-taking incentives. If an executive's expected payoff is highly nonlinear over the range of potential stock price and volatility outcomes, a local measure of incentives is unlikely to provide a valid assessment of managerial incentives. Third, Vega is measured as the partial derivative of the manager's equity portfolio with respect to return volatility. This computation does not consider that this partial derivative also varies with changes in stock price. The second paper develops and tests a new measure of managerial risk-taking equity incentives that adjusts for differences in managerial wealth, considers more global changes in price and volatility, and explicitly considers the impact of stock price and volatility changes. We find that our new measure exhibits higher explanatory power and is more robust to model specification than Vegafor explaining a wide range of measures of risk-taking behavior. 3. The third paper examines the relation between shareholder monitoring and managerial risk-taking incentives. We develop a stylized model to show that shareholder monitoring mitigates the effect of contractual risk-taking incentives on the manager's actions. Consistent with the model, we find empirically that the positive association between the CEO's contractual risk-taking incentives and risk-taking behavior decreases with the level of shareholder monitoring. Furthermore, consistent with the board anticipating and optimally responding to shareholder monitoring, boards of firms exposed to more intense monitoring design compensation contracts that provide higher incentives to take risks. Overall, our results suggest that, when evaluating risk-taking incentives provided by a compensation contract, it is important to account for the firm's monitoring environment.","2011","http://books.google.es/books?id=s0v0nXUlQRcC&printsec=frontcover&dq=risk+%2B+structures&hl=&cd=22&source=gbs_api","STANFORD:hp926sh2992",
"Project Risk Governance. Managing Uncertainty and Creating Organisational Value","risk + structures","[Dr Dieter Fink]","[Business & Economics]","In Project Risk Governance, Dieter Fink breaks new ground in two ways. Firstly, he places project risk management in the context of today’s organisations in which objectives are increasingly implemented through projects to better respond to fast-changing markets. Secondly, he applies a governance perspective to examine project risk at the project and corporate levels, an approach which is significantly under-researched and for which theoretical knowledge and professional practice are at an early stage of maturity. Topics addressed relate to governance, strategy, value management and building enterprise-wide Project Risk Governance (PRG) capabilities. Chapters examine the role of projects in organisations and the need to integrate project and business strategy within the framework of the Project-Based Organisation. PRG is introduced via its links with corporate and project governance and its scope is covered in chapters that identify relevant processes, structures and relationship mechanisms. The final chapter provides a roadmap to the stages and dimensions of a PRG maturity model.","2014-01-28","http://books.google.es/books?id=2f2AAgAAQBAJ&pg=PT89&dq=risk+%2B+structures&hl=&cd=23&source=gbs_api","9781472419064",

Indeed, inherent scatter exists in initial material quality and in material performance. Furthermore, projections of component usage in determination of applied stresses are inexact at best and are subject to much discrepancy between projected and actual usage. Even the models for predicting life contain inherent sources of error based on assumptions and/or empirically fitted parameters. All of these factors need to be accounted for to determine a distribution of potential lives based on combination of the aforementioned variables, as well as other factors.

"Life Settlements and Longevity Structures. Pricing and Risk Management","risk + structures","[Geoff Chaplin, Jim Aspinwall, Mark Venn]","[Business & Economics]","Recent turbulence in the financial markets has highlighted the need for diversified portfolios with lower correlations between the different investments. Life settlements meet this need, offering investors the prospect of high, stable returns, uncorrelated with the broader financial markets. This book provides readers of all levels of experience with essential information on the process surrounding the acquisition and management of a portfolio of life settlements; the assessment, modelling and mitigation of the associated longevity, interest rate and credit risks; and practical approaches to financing and risk management structures. It begins with the history of life insurance and looks at how the need for new financing sources has led to the growth of the life settlements market in the United States. The authors provide a detailed exploration of the mathematical formulae surrounding the generation of mortality curves, drawing a parallel between the tools deployed in the credit derivatives market and those available to model longevity risk. Structured products and securitisation techniques are introduced and explained, starting with simple vanilla products and models before illustrating some of the investment structures associated with life settlements. Capital market mechanisms available to assist the investor in limiting the risks associated with life settlement portfolios are outlined, as are opportunities to use life settlement portfolios to mitigate the risks of traditional capital markets. The last section of the book covers derivative products, either available now or under consideration, that will reduce or potentially eliminate longevity risks within life settlement portfolios. It then reviews hedging and risk management strategies and considers how to measure the effectiveness of risk mitigation.","2011-03-29","http://books.google.es/books?id=vCUN-X6XM3QC&pg=PA169&dq=risk+%2B+structures&hl=&cd=29&source=gbs_api","9780470746899",

"Counterparty Credit Risk. The new challenge for global financial markets","risk + structures","[Jon Gregory]","[Business & Economics]","The first decade of the 21st Century has been disastrous for financial institutions, derivatives and risk management. Counterparty credit risk has become the key element of financial risk management, highlighted by the bankruptcy of the investment bank Lehman Brothers and failure of other high profile institutions such as Bear Sterns, AIG, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. The sudden realisation of extensive counterparty risks has severely compromised the health of global financial markets. Counterparty risk is now a key problem for all financial institutions. This book explains the emergence of counterparty risk during the recent credit crisis. The quantification of firm-wide credit exposure for trading desks and businesses is discussed alongside risk mitigation methods such as netting and collateral management (margining). Banks and other financial institutions have been recently developing their capabilities for pricing counterparty risk and these elements are considered in detail via a characterisation of credit value adjustment (CVA). The implications of an institution valuing their own default via debt value adjustment (DVA) are also considered at length. Hedging aspects, together with the associated instruments such as credit defaults swaps (CDSs) and contingent CDS (CCDS) are described in full. A key feature of the credit crisis has been the realisation of wrong-way risks illustrated by the failure of monoline insurance companies. Wrong-way counterparty risks are addressed in detail in relation to interest rate, foreign exchange, commodity and, in particular, credit derivative products. Portfolio counterparty risk is covered, together with the regulatory aspects as defined by the Basel II capital requirements. The management of counterparty risk within an institution is also discussed in detail. Finally, the design and benefits of central clearing, a recent development to attempt to control the rapid growth of counterparty risk, is considered. This book is unique in being practically focused but also covering the more technical aspects. It is an invaluable complete reference guide for any market practitioner with any responsibility or interest within the area of counterparty credit risk.","2011-09-07","http://books.google.es/books?id=7v4QMegBhGUC&pg=PA234&dq=risk+%2B+structures&hl=&cd=39&source=gbs_api","9780470689998",

Focusing on practical real-world problem solving and model building, as opposed to algorithms and theory, Risk Assessment and Decision Analysis with Bayesian Networks explains how to incorporate knowledge with data to develop and use (Bayesian) causal models of risk that provide powerful insights and better decision making. Provides all tools necessary to build and run realistic Bayesian network models Supplies extensive example models based on real risk assessment problems in a wide range of application domains provided; for example, finance, safety, systems reliability, law, and more Introduces all necessary mathematics, probability, and statistics as needed The book first establishes the basics of probability, risk, and building and using BN models, then goes into the detailed applications. The underlying BN algorithms appear in appendices rather than the main text since there is no need to understand them to build and use BN models. Keeping the body of the text free of intimidating mathematics, the book provides pragmatic advice about model building to ensure models are built efficiently. A dedicated website, www.BayesianRisk.com, contains executable versions of all of the models described, exercises and worked solutions for all chapters, PowerPoint slides, numerous other resources, and a free downloadable copy of the AgenaRisk software.","2012-11-07","http://books.google.es/books?id=p9CmmpIVzJEC&printsec=frontcover&dq=risk+%2B+network&hl=&cd=4&source=gbs_api","9781439809105",
"Risk Management for Computer Security. Protecting Your Network and Information Assets","risk + network","[Andy Jones, Debi Ashenden]","[Business & Economics]","The information systems security (InfoSec) profession remains one of the fastest growing professions in the world today. With the advent of the Internet and its use as a method of conducting business, even more emphasis is being placed on InfoSec. However, there is an expanded field of threats that must be addressed by today's InfoSec and information assurance (IA) professionals. Operating within a global business environment with elements of a virtual workforce can create problems not experienced in the past. How do you assess the risk to the organization when information can be accessed, remotely, by employees in the field or while they are traveling internationally? How do you assess the risk to employees who are not working on company premises and are often thousands of miles from the office? How do you assess the risk to your organization and its assets when you have offices or facilities in a nation whose government may be supporting the theft of the corporate ""crown jewels"" in order to assist their own nationally owned or supported corporations? If your risk assessment and management program is to be effective, then these issues must be assessed. Personnel involved in the risk assessment and management process face a much more complex environment today than they have ever encountered before. This book covers more than just the fundamental elements that make up a good risk program. It provides an integrated ""how to"" approach to implementing a corporate program, complete with tested methods and processes; flowcharts; and checklists that can be used by the reader and immediately implemented into a computer and overall corporate security program.

"Social Risk Networks and HIV/AIDS Among Fishing Boat Crews in Benoa Port, Bali","risk + network","[I Made Setiawan]",,"Since the late 1990s, the Indonesian government acknowledged that the national HIV/AIDS epidemic had escalated from a ""low-level"" to a ""concentrated"" epidemic. National adult prevalence was reported as 0.1% for 2001, while the 2007 estimate for Bali province is 0.2%. Indonesia is the world's largest archipelago, with approximately 17,500 islands and 755 fishing ports. Benoa Port in Bali is one of Indonesia's major fishing ports with at least 800 fishing boats. A social network approach was used to investigate STD- and HIV/AIDS-related risk among fishermen at this port. The intent was to determine if social networks among the fishermen correlate with the types of risk-taking practices, and/or with their level of HIV/AIDS/STD knowledge and attitudes. Twenty-nine fishermen participated in a formal semi-structured interview, including almost every crewmember of three small fishing boats. The participants ranged in age from 19 to 44 years old, and all were migrant workers from Java. Participant observations were also conducted among sex-buying fishermen.","2008","http://books.google.es/books?id=6oAtx7I06TgC&pg=PA23&dq=risk+%2B+network&hl=&cd=6&source=gbs_api","0549645926",

"Risk Propagation Assessment for Network Security. Application to Airport Communication Network Design","risk + network","[Mohamed Slim Ben Mahmoud, Nicolas Larrieu, Aliain Pirovano]","[Technology & Engineering]","The focus of this book is risk assessment methodologies for network architecture design. The main goal is to present and illustrate an innovative risk propagation-based quantitative assessment tool. This original approach aims to help network designers and security administrators to design and build more robust and secure network topologies. As an implementation case study, the authors consider an aeronautical network based on AeroMACS (Aeronautical Mobile Airport Communications System) technology. AeroMACS has been identified as the wireless access network for airport surface communications that will soon be deployed in European and American airports mainly for communications between aircraft and airlines. It is based on the IEEE 802.16-2009 standard, also known as WiMAX. The book begins with an introduction to the information system security risk management process, before moving on to present the different risk management methodologies that can be currently used (quantitative and qualitative). In the third part of the book, the authors’ original quantitative network risk assessment model based on risk propagation is introduced. Finally, a network case study of the future airport AeroMACS system is presented. This example illustrates how the authors’ quantitative risk assessment proposal can provide help to network security designers for the decision-making process and how the security of the entire network may thus be improved.

"Decision Support Systems for Risk-Based Management of Contaminated Sites","risk + network","[Antonio Marcomini, Glenn Walter Suter II, Andrea Critto]","[Business & Economics]","Decision Support Systems for Risk-Based Management of Contaminated Sites addresses decision making in environmental risk management for contaminated sites, focusing on the potential role of decision support systems in informing the management of chemical pollutants and their effects. Considering the environmental relevance and the financial impacts of contaminated sites all over the post-industrialized countries and the complexity of decision making in environmental risk management, decision support systems can be used by decision makers in order to have a more structured analysis of a problem at hand and define possible options of intervention to solve the problem. Accordingly, the book provides an analysis of the main steps and tools for the development of decision support systems, namely: environmental risk assessment, decision analysis, spatial analysis and geographic information system, indicators and endpoints. Sections are dedicated to the review of decision support systems for contaminated land management and for inland and coastal waters management. Both include discussions of management problem formulation and of the application of specific decision support systems. This book is a valuable support for environmental risk managers and for decision makers involved in a sustainable management of contaminated sites, including contaminated lands, river basins and coastal lagoons. Furthermore, it is a basic tool for the environmental scientists who gather data and perform assessments to support decisions, developers of decision support systems, students of environmental science and members of the public who wish to understand the assessment science that supports remedial decisions.","2008-12-16","http://books.google.es/books?id=BARkt4spU8cC&pg=PA257&dq=risk+%2B+network&hl=&cd=9&source=gbs_api","9780387097220",

"Risk Pricing Strategies for Public-Private Partnership Projects","risk + network","[Abdelhalim Boussabaine]","[Technology & Engineering]","The complexity of public-private partnership project procurement requires an effective process for pricing, managing and appropriate allocation of risks. The level at which risk is priced and the magnitude of risks transferred to the private sector will have a significant impact on the cost of the PPP deals as well as on the value for money analysis and on the section of the optimum investment options. The construction industry tends to concentrate on the effectiveness of risk management strategies and to some extent ignores the price of risk and its impact on whole life cost of building assets. There is a pressing need for a universal framework for the determination of fair value of risks throughout the PPP procurement processes. Risk Pricing Strategies for Public-Private Partnership Projects addresses the issues of risk pricing and demonstrates the use of a coherent strategy to arrive at a fair risk price. The focus of the book is on providing risk pricing strategies to maximise return on risk retention and allocation in the procurement of PPP projects. With its up-to-date coverage of the latest developments in risk pricing and comprehensive treatment of the methodologies involved in designing and building risk pricing strategies, the book offers a simple model for pricing risks. The book follows a thematic structure: PPP processes map; Risk, uncertainty and bias; Risk pricing management strategies; Risk pricing measurement and modelling; Risk pricing at each of the project life cycle stages – and deals with all the important risk pricing issues, using relevant real-world situations through case study examples. It explains how the theory and strategies of risk pricing can be successfully applied to real PPP projects and reflects the broad understanding required by today’s project risk analysts, in their new and important role in PPP contract management.","2013-10-02","http://books.google.es/books?id=7ZgzAQAAQBAJ&pg=PA187&dq=risk+%2B+network&hl=&cd=11&source=gbs_api","9781118785720",

"Evaluation of an Evidence-based and Integrated Prevention Curriculum for High Risk Populations in Bexar County, Texas","risk + network","[Amos Frederick Casanova]",,"This study represents an original and unduplicated evaluation of an evidence-based integrated prevention intervention comparing the effectiveness of an academic research institution's educators to a community-based organization's educators. The purpose of this study is to enhance current thought in high-risk preventive intervention practices by offering an academic research alternative when addressing the type of educator(s) most capable of efficient and effective education. This study evaluates the delivery of a peer modeled intervention measuring the efficiency, accuracy and effectiveness of the educators, and the behavioral and knowledge outcomes of the participants. Methods. Thirty locally developed fidelity checks were administered to assess the efficiency and accuracy of the educator's delivery of the ten-session Substance Abuse/HIV/Hepatitis curriculum. Ninety-three Bexar County Drug Court participants and their sexual partners completed baseline, exit, and follow-up questions in order to measure substance use, HIV/hepatitis, and psychosocial behavior outcomes. The same sample completed a total of ten HIV/hepatitis pre and post questions to measure knowledge outcomes. Conclusions. The results from the study suggest that there are clear differences in the educational delivery of the curriculum between the community-based educators and the academic-based research institution's educators. The academic institution's educators were found to be more likely to deliver the curriculum in a more efficient and accurate manner compared to the community-based organization's educators. Regarding behavioral outcomes, although there were no significant differences between the two agencies, a slight decrease in mean days of marijuana use was observed when the academic-based institution delivered the curriculum. Similarly, the same result was observed in terms of illegal drugs used when the community-based organization administered the education. Additionally, an experimental effect interaction showed that there was no significant change across time for all substance use and no significant effect for either agency. Regarding HIV and hepatitis knowledge outcomes, a significant increase in knowledge was observed for both agencies, although the academic-based institution revealed a higher mean score at post questionnaire than the community-based organization.","2009","http://books.google.es/books?id=kcR2UHZ1l7QC&pg=PA19&dq=risk+%2B+network&hl=&cd=20&source=gbs_api","1109123108",

"Systemic Risk from Global Financial Derivatives: A Network Analysis of Contagion and Its Mitigation with Super-Spreader Tax","risk + network","[Ms. Sheri M. Markose]","[Business & Economics]","Financial network analysis is used to provide firm level bottom-up holistic visualizations of interconnections of financial obligations in global OTC derivatives markets. This helps to identify Systemically Important Financial Intermediaries (SIFIs), analyse the nature of contagion propagation, and also monitor and design ways of increasing robustness in the network. Based on 2009 FDIC and individually collected firm level data covering gross notional, gross positive (negative) fair value and the netted derivatives assets and liabilities for 202 financial firms which includes 20 SIFIs, the bilateral flows are empirically calibrated to reflect data-based constraints. This produces a tiered network with a distinct highly clustered central core of 12 SIFIs that account for 78 percent of all bilateral exposures and a large number of financial intermediaries (FIs) on the periphery. The topology of the network results in the Too- Interconnected-To-Fail (TITF) phenomenon in that the failure of any member of the central tier will bring down other members with the contagion coming to an abrupt end when the super-spreaders have demised. As these SIFIs account for the bulk of capital in the system, ipso facto no bank among the top tier can be allowed to fail, highlighting the untenable implicit socialized guarantees needed for these markets to operate at their current levels. Systemic risk costs of highly connected SIFIs nodes are not priced into their holding of capital or collateral. An eigenvector centrality based super-spreader tax has been designed and tested for its capacity to reduce the potential socialized losses from failure of SIFIs.","2012-11-30","http://books.google.es/books?id=aekZcqS-FKIC&pg=PA12&dq=risk+%2B+network&hl=&cd=23&source=gbs_api","1616353074",
"The Project Risk Maturity Model. Measuring and Improving Risk Management Capability","risk + network","[Martin Hopkinson]","[Business & Economics]","Top businesses recognise risk management as a core feature of their project management process and approach to the governance of projects. However, a mature risk management process is required in order to realise its benefits; one that takes into account the design and implementation of the process and the skills, experience and culture of the people who use it. To be mature in the way you manage risk you need an accepted framework to assess your risk management maturity, allowing you to benchmark against a recognised standard. A structured pathway for improvement is also needed, not just telling you where you are now, but describing the steps required to reach the next level. The Project Risk Maturity Model detailed here provides such an assessment framework and development pathway. It can be used to benchmark your project risk processes and support the introduction of effective in-house project risk management. Using this model, implementation and improvement of project risk management can be managed effectively to ensure that the expected benefits are achieved in a way that is appropriate to the needs of each organisation. Martin Hopkinson has developed the Project Risk Maturity Model into a robust framework, and this book allows you to access and apply his insights and experience. A key feature is a CD containing a working copy of the QinetiQ Project Risk Maturity Model (RMM). This will enable you to undertake maturity assessments for as many projects as you choose. The RMM has been proven over a period of 10 years, with at least 250 maturity assessments on projects and programmes with a total value exceeding £60 billion. A case study in the book demonstrates how it has been used to deliver significant and measurable benefits to the performance of major projects. `The Project Risk Maturity Model provides an answer for those who know that they haven't yet peaked in project risk management capability, or who want to maintain or improve their ability to manage project risk. Martin Hopkinson has done a great job over the past 10 years in developing the Project Risk Maturity Model into a robust framework, and this book allows others to access and apply his insights and experience. I'm pleased to recommend it.'---Dr David Hillson, The Risk Doctor","2011","http://books.google.es/books?id=siCgIVi-z6sC&pg=PA155&dq=risk+%2B+network&hl=&cd=24&source=gbs_api","0566088797",

Theory and Practice of Managing Risk","risk + network","[Haresh Gurnani, Anuj Mehrotra, Saibal Ray]","[Business & Economics]","One of the most critical issues facing supply chain managers in today’s globalized and highly uncertain business environments is how to deal proactively with disruptions that might affect the complicated supply networks characterizing modern enterprises. Supply Chain Disruptions: Theory and Practice of Managing Risk presents a state-of the-art perspective on this particular issue.Supply Chain Disruptions: Theory and Practice of Managing Risk demonstrates that effective management of supply disruptions necessitates both strategic and tactical measures – the former involving optimal design of supply networks; the latter involving inventory, finance and demand management. It shows that managers ought to use all available levers at their disposal throughout the supply network – like sourcing and pricing strategies, providing financial subsidies, encouraging information sharing and incentive alignment between supply chain partners – in order to tackle supply disruptions. The editors combine up-to-date academic research with the latest operational risk management practices used in industry to demonstrate how theoreticians and practitioners can learn from each other.As well as providing a wealth of knowledge for students and professors who are interested in pursuing research or teaching courses in the rapidly growing area of supply chain risk management, Supply Chain Disruptions: Theory and Practice of Managing Risk also acts as a ready reference for practitioners who are interested in understanding the theoretical underpinnings of effective supply disruption management techniques.","2011-09-28","http://books.google.es/books?id=yf2BH067NDUC&printsec=frontcover&dq=risk+%2B+network&hl=&cd=31&source=gbs_api","0857297783",

With value from micro-level personal networking to macro-level outreach, social networking has become pervasive in people’s lives and is now becoming a significant driving force in business. These new platforms have provided new approaches to many critical enterprise functions, including identifying, communicating, and gathering feedback with customers (e.g., Facebook, Ning); locating expertise (e.g., LinkedIn); providing new communication platforms (e.g., Twitter); and collaborating with a community, small or large (e.g., wikis). However, many organizations have stayed away from potential benefits of social networks because of the significant risks associated with them. This book will help an organization understand the risks present in social networks and provide a framework covering policy, training and technology to address those concerns and mitigate the risks presented to leverage social media in their organization. The book also acknowledges that many organizations have already exposed themselves to more risk than they think from social networking and offers strategies for ""dialing it back"" to retake control.

"Population Mobility and Infectious Disease","risk + networks","[Yorghos Apostolopoulos, Sevil Sonmez]","[Medical]","Population Mobility and Infectious Disease moves beyond traditional behavioral and demographic theories of disease diffusion to focus on larger issues of social ecology and public health. With depth rarely seen in the international literature, it explores the complex and varied roles of mobile, transient, and displaced populations in the worldwide spread of airborne, waterborne, and sexually transmitted infections. The book argues that while biomedical events cause disease, social forces such as poverty and marginalization magnify them by giving them new opportunities to take hold. Population mobility either voluntary or forced brings contact between populations with different disease prevalence rates; outbreaks in turn are compounded by inequalities in access to medical care. From Katrina to Darfur, and from influenza to AIDS, an expert panel of health and social scientists bring the socioeconomic context of epidemics into clear focus: Historical perspectives on migration, development, and epidemics; Social resources and health barriers among migrant groups; The role of mobile labor populations (e.g., migrant workers, truckers, the military) in disease transmission; War, refugees, resettlement: health effects on the world scale; Natural disasters and climate change: their local and global disease impact; Leisure travel and health risks, from spring-break binges to commercial sex tourism; Methodological and design issues confronting researchers; The politics of prevention: ethical concerns in migration-related illness. The unique scope of this book makes it as timely as the next health crisis and relevant to a gamut of interrelated fields, including public and international health, epidemiology, psychology, sociology, anthropology, human rights, and development and planning. By expanding concepts, examining trends, and pinpointing areas for intervention, it is a critical resource for the academic, research, practice, and policy sectors.","2007-05-06","http://books.google.es/books?id=R9DCeSqWAGwC&pg=PA143&dq=risk+%2B+networks&hl=&cd=26&source=gbs_api","9780387497112",
"Game Theoretic Risk Analysis of Security Threats","risk + networks","[Vicki M. Bier, M. Naceur Azaiez]","[Mathematics]","Game Theoretic Risk Analysis of Security Threats introduces reliability and risk analysis in the face of threats by intelligent agents. More specifically, game-theoretic models will be developed for identifying optimal and/or equilibrium defense and attack strategies in systems of varying degrees of complexity. The book covers applications to networks, including problems in both telecommunications and transportation. However, the book's primary focus is to integrate game theory and reliability methodologies into unified techniques to predict, detect, diminish, and stop intentional attacks at targets that vary in complexity. In this book, leading researchers combine reliability and risk analysis with game theory methods to create a set of functional tools that can be used by security personnel to offset intentional, intelligent threats (including the threats of terrorism and war). This means a comprehensive treatment of such problems must consider two aspects: (1) the structure of the system to be protected and (2) the adaptive nature of the threat (that is, beyond the static nature of the threat). The book provides a set of scientific tools for analyzing and applying game-theoretic reliability problems in the presence of intentional, intelligent threats. These scientific tools address problems of global safety and create more cost-effective defensive investments.","2008-10-20","http://books.google.es/books?id=659orlQB-8sC&printsec=frontcover&dq=risk+%2B+networks&hl=&cd=28&source=gbs_api","9780387877679",

AIDS crosses geopolitical and social barriers, and social and behavioral scientists are confronted with the new challenge of developing scientific inquiry and corresponding interventions around participatory, community-based, and community-focused methods. These interventions are increasingly targeting the contextual influences on individual behavior, such as peer groups, social networks and support systems, and community norms. Community-level interventions also draw on local resources and are respectful of sociocultural circumstances and traditions. This book articulates how the social and behavioral sciences can respond to HIV/AIDS. It is written for all who have a stake in AIDS research, stimulating discussion and debate about the natures of community research and intervention broadly across such disciplines as public health, community health education, urban planning, psychology, sociology, anthropology, and philosophy of science. The book proposes alternative perspectives on means of ascertaining knowledge about the HIV/AIDS pandemic and the inclusion of community collaboration in interventions.","2005-08-06","http://books.google.es/books?id=s470IqHTf_MC&pg=PA110&dq=risk+%2B+networks&hl=&cd=30&source=gbs_api","9780198036333",

Health theories in general have been based on studies of men. However, in recent years, more attention has shifted to women's health, realizing the disparities between men and women in relation to their health. During the last two decades, a similar shift has occurred for a group of women--lesbian women--to further identify and specify their health needs. Over the past decade, lesbians have organized to call for attention to the health issues of this community, resulting in several federally funded research initiatives. This book offers a comprehensive view of what is known about lesbian health needs and what questions need further investigation, including: How do we define who is lesbian? Are there unique health issues for lesbians? Are lesbians at higher or lower risk for such health problems as AIDS, sexually transmitted diseases, breast cancer, mental disorders, and substance abuse? How does homophobia affect lesbian health and the funding of research on lesbian health? How do lesbian health needs fit into the health care system and the larger society? What risk and protective factors shape the physical and mental health of lesbians? The book discusses how to determine which questions to ask about sexual orientation, the need to obtain information without violating privacy, the importance of considering racial and ethnic diversity in the study of lesbians, strategies for exchanging information among researchers and disseminating findings to the public, and mechanisms for supporting greater numbers of researchers. Lesbian Health takes a frank look at the political pressures, community attitudes, and professional concerns uniquely affecting the study of lesbian health issues. The book explores many other issues including the potential for transferring findings in this field to other population groups, including other rare populations and women in general.","1999-05-25","http://books.google.es/books?id=jVzGMF25uasC&pg=PA86&dq=risk+%2B+networks&hl=&cd=32&source=gbs_api","9780309174060",

"Instrument Engineers' Handbook. Process Software and Digital Networks, Fourth Edition","risk + networked","[Bela G. Liptak, Halit Eren]","[Technology & Engineering]","Instrument Engineers' Handbook – Volume 3: Process Software and Digital Networks, Fourth Edition is the latest addition to an enduring collection that industrial automation (AT) professionals often refer to as the ""bible."" First published in 1970, the entire handbook is approximately 5,000 pages, designed as standalone volumes that cover the measurement (Volume 1), control (Volume 2), and software (Volume 3) aspects of automation. This fourth edition of the third volume provides an in-depth, state-of-the-art review of control software packages used in plant optimization, control, maintenance, and safety. Each updated volume of this renowned reference requires about ten years to prepare, so revised installments have been issued every decade, taking into account the numerous developments that occur from one publication to the next. Assessing the rapid evolution of automation and optimization in control systems used in all types of industrial plants, this book details the wired/wireless communications and software used. This includes the ever-increasing number of applications for intelligent instruments, enhanced networks, Internet use, virtual private networks, and integration of control systems with the main networks used by management, all of which operate in a linked global environment. Topics covered include: Advances in new displays, which help operators to more quickly assess and respond to plant conditions Software and networks that help monitor, control, and optimize industrial processes, to determine the efficiency, energy consumption, and profitability of operations Strategies to counteract changes in market conditions and energy and raw material costs Techniques to fortify the safety of plant operations and the security of digital communications systems This volume explores why the holistic approach to integrating process and enterprise networks is convenient and efficient, despite associated problems involving cyber and local network security, energy conservation, and other issues. It shows how firewalls must separate the business (IT) and the operation (automation technology, or AT) domains to guarantee the safe function of all industrial plants. This book illustrates how these concerns must be addressed using effective technical solutions and proper management policies and practices. Reinforcing the fact that all industrial control systems are, in general, critically interdependent, this handbook provides a wide range of software application examples from industries including: automotive, mining, renewable energy, steel, dairy, pharmaceutical, mineral processing, oil, gas, electric power, utility, and nuclear power.","2011-08-19","http://books.google.es/books?id=zKKG3ZuOtYgC&pg=PA702&dq=risk+%2B+networked&hl=&cd=4&source=gbs_api","9781439817766",

"Engineering Risk and Finance","risk + networked","[Charles S. Tapiero]","[BUSINESS & ECONOMICS]","Risk models are models of uncertainty, engineered for some purposes. They are ""educated guesses and hypotheses"" assessed and valued in terms of well-defined future states and their consequences. They are engineered to predict, to manage countable and accountable futures and to provide a frame of reference within which we may believe that ""uncertainty is tamed."" Quantitative-statistical tools are used to reconcile our information, experience and other knowledge with hypotheses that both serve as the foundation of risk models and also value and price risk. Risk models are therefore common to most professions, each with its own methods and techniques based on their needs, experience and a wisdom accrued over long periods of time.This book provides a broad and interdisciplinary foundation to engineering risks and to their financial valuation and pricing. Risk models applied in industry and business, heath care, safety, the environment and regulation are used to highlight their variety while financial valuation techniques are used to assess their financial consequences.This book is technically accessible to all readers and students with a basic background in probability and statistics (with 3 chapters devoted to introduce their elements). Principles of risk measurement, valuation and financial pricing as well as the economics of uncertainty are outlined in 5 chapters with numerous examples and applications. New results, extending classical models such as the CCAPM are presented providing insights to assess the risks and their price in an interconnected, dependent and strategic economic environment. In an environment departing from the fundamental assumptions we make regarding financial markets, the book provides a strategic/game-like approach to assess the risk and the opportunities that such an environment implies. To control these risks, a strategic-control approach is developed that recognizes that many risks result by ""what we do"" as well as ""what others do"". In particular we address the strategic and statistical control of compliance in large financial institutions confronted increasingly with a complex and far more extensive regulation.","2013-02-13","http://books.google.es/books?id=AVBGAAAAQBAJ&pg=PA25&dq=risk+%2B+networked&hl=&cd=6&source=gbs_api","9781461462347",

"War in an Age of Risk","risk + networked","[Christopher Coker]","[Political Science]","Wars throughout history have been fought in the name of ideology, religion and the pursuit of peace. Our thinking about war - when it is justified, how it should be fought and how it is perceived - has changed dramatically over time. Whereas in the past war has been seen as a battle of wills, this provocative and illuminating new book shows how war has evolved into an exercise in risk management. In a rare blend of political science, sociology, history and cultural thought, Christopher Coker peels away the layers of meaning shrouding our current understanding of war and warfare. Using the ideas of writers such as Zygmunt Bauman, Ulrich Beck and Frank Furedi, he shows that risk has become the language of business, politics and public policy and so we should not be surprised that it has now become the language of war. The book highlights the increasing difference between homeland security and national security in the modern world, arguing that the defense of the citizen is often now more challenging than the defense of the state. By demonstrating the changing character and complexity of conflict from World War I to the current the current fight against terrorism, the book provides a powerful and highly distinctive account of the re-branding of war in an age of risk. This book is set to ignite debate amongst students and scholars of international politics as well as appealing to anyone interested in war and its place in contemporary society.","2013-04-16","http://books.google.es/books?id=icu_nIqFR8UC&pg=PA125&dq=risk+%2B+networked&hl=&cd=13&source=gbs_api","9780745672649",

Some of them revealed the potentiality of vast impact on the welfare of society and triggered pressing questions on the reliability of electric power systems. Society has incorporated electricity as an inherent component, indispensable for achieving the expected level of quality of life. Therefore, any impingement on the continuity of the electricity service would be able to distress society as a whole, affecting individuals, social and economic activities, other infrastructures and essential government functions. It would be possible to hypothesize that in extreme situations this could even upset national security. This book explores the potential risks and vulnerabilities of the European electricity infrastructure, other infrastructures and our society as whole increasingly depend on. The work was initiated by the need to verify the potential effects of the ongoing market and technical transformation of the infrastructure, which is fundamentally changing its operation and performance. The final aim is to set the basis for an appropriate industrial and political European-wide response to the risk challenges.","2006-02-15","http://books.google.es/books?id=7NCSioKpuMkC&pg=PA19&dq=risk+%2B+networked&hl=&cd=25&source=gbs_api","9781402043642",

Risk and vulnerability analyses are needed to grasp the impact of threats and hazards. However, these become quite complex as there are strong interdependencies both within and between infrastructure systems. Risk and Interdependencies in Critical Infrastructures: A guideline for analysis provides methods for analyzing risks and interdependencies of critical infrastructures. A number of analysis approaches are described and are adapted to each of these infrastructures. Various approaches are also revised, and all are supported by several examples and illustrations. Particular emphasis is given to the analysis of various interdependencies that often exist between the infrastructures. Risk and Interdependencies in Critical Infrastructures: A guideline for analysis provides a good tool to identify the hazards that are threatening your infrastructures, and will enhance the understanding on how these threats can propagate throughout the system and also affect other infrastructures, thereby identifying useful risk reducing measures. It is essential reading for municipalities and infrastructure owners that are obliged to know about and prepare for the risks and vulnerabilities of the critical infrastructures for which they are responsible.","2012-12-18","http://books.google.es/books?id=jlSqPun81k4C&pg=PA192&dq=risk+%2B+networked&hl=&cd=26&source=gbs_api","9781447146612",
"Critical Infrastructure Protection in Homeland Security. Defending a Networked Nation","risk + networked","[Ted G. Lewis]","[Technology & Engineering]","A scientific approach to the new field of critical infrastructure protection This book offers a unique scientific approach to the new field of critical infrastructure protection: it uses network theory, optimization theory, and simulation software to analyze and understand how infrastructure sectors evolve, where they are vulnerable, and how they can best be protected. The author demonstrates that infrastructure sectors as diverse as water, power, energy, telecommunications, and the Internet have remarkably similar structures. This observation leads to a rigorous approach to vulnerability analysis in all of these sectors. The analyst can then decide the best way to allocate limited funds to minimize risk, regardless of industry sector. The key question addressed in this timely book is: What should be protected and how? The author proposes that the answer lies in allocating a nation's scarce resources to the most critical components of each infra-structure--the so-called critical nodes. Using network theory as a foundation, readers learn how to identifya small handful of critical nodes and then allocate resources to reduce or eliminate risk across the entire sector.

"The Global Brain. Your Roadmap for Innovating Faster and Smarter in a Networked World","risk + networked","[Satish Nambisan, Mohanbir Sawhney]","[Business & Economics]","All the talk about ""open innovation"" and externally-focused innovation assumes that ""one size fits all"" in terms of what network-centric innovation is and how companies should harness external creativity. But the reality is that there is no one right way to master this tool. For instance, loosely governed community-based innovation projects are a very different animal from tightly-orchestrated development projects driven by a large firm. As the landscape of network-centric innovation becomes more diverse and more confusing, there is a desperate need to structure the landscape to better understand different models for network-centric innovation. This book brings clarity to the confusion. Further, it argues that managers cannot rely on anecdotal success stories they read about in the press to implement a network-centric innovation strategy. They need rigorous and analytical advice on what role their company should play in an innovation network, what capabilities they need to create, and how they need to prepare their organization for this significant shift in the innovation approach. This book offers a practical and detailed roadmap for planning and implementing an externally-focused innovation strategy.","2007-10","http://books.google.es/books?id=RGmeRUwghCUC&pg=PA186&dq=risk+%2B+networked&hl=&cd=33&source=gbs_api","9780137064861",

"The Role of Ecosystems in Disaster Risk Reduction","risk + ecosystem","[Fabrice G. Renaud, Karen Sudmeier-Rieux, Marisol Estrella]","[Political Science]","The increasing worldwide trend in disasters, which will be aggravated by global environmental change (including climate change), urges us to implement new approaches to hazard mitigation, as well as exposure and vulnerability reduction. We are, however, faced with hard choices about hazard mitigation: should we continue to build dikes and walls to protect ourselves against floods and coastal hazards - though we have seen the limitsof these - or should we consider alternative, ecosystem-based solutions? Ecosystem management is a well-tested solution to sustainable development that is being revisited because of its inherent ""win-win"" and ""no-regrets"" appeal to address rising disaster and climate change issues. It is one of the few approaches that can impact all elements of the disaster risk equation - mitigating hazards, reducing exposure, reducing vulnerabilitiesand increasing the resilience of exposed communities. Yet, the uptake of ecosystem-based approaches for disaster risk reduction (DRR) is slow despite some very good examples of success stories. Reasons for this are multiple: ecosystem management is rarely considered as part of the portfolio of DRR solutions because the environmental and disaster management communities typically work independently from each other; its contribution to DRR is highly undervalued compared to engineered solutions and thus not attributed appropriate budget allocations; finally, there are poor science-policy interactions on ecosystem-based DRR, which have led to unclear and sometimes contradictory scientific information on the role of ecosystems in DRR. The aim of this book is to provide an overview of knowledge and practice in the multidisciplinary field of ecosystem management and DRR to encourage and further develop dialogues between scientists, practitioners, policymakers and development planners.","2013","http://books.google.es/books?id=9mTRjKmN1LwC&pg=PA27&dq=risk+%2B+ecosystem&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api","9789280812213",

Suter II]","[Technology & Engineering]","The definitive reference in its field, Ecological Risk Assessment, Second Edition details the latest advances in science and practice. In the fourteen years since the publication of the best-selling first edition, ecological risk assessment (ERA) has moved from the margins into the spotlight. It is now commonly applied to the regulation of chemicals, the remediation of contaminated sites, the monitoring of importation of exotic organisms, the management of watersheds, and other environmental management issues. Delineating the processes for performing an ERA, the book begins by defining the field, then goes on to describe its relationship to other environmental assessment practices and its organizational framework. The book also includes a chapter on ecological epidemiology, which has previously been treated as a type of ERA, but is now recognized as a distinct practice in itself. It explores important concepts in the ERA process including probability, uncertainty, scale, mode of action and multiple causes. Reflecting changes in the field, the book’s scope has been broadened to include discussions of the application of ERA to agents other than chemical contaminants. The multitude of illustrative figures provides a flavor for the diverse practice of ERA. The author has re-organized the material, presenting a unitary process of ERA that is applicable to various problems, scales, and mandates. He keeps the emphasis squarely on providing clear, scientifically sound, and unbiased technical advice on the risks from chemicals and chemical mixtures.","2006-12-06","http://books.google.es/books?id=p_x2AoSKTegC&pg=PA414&dq=risk+%2B+ecosystem&hl=&cd=3&source=gbs_api","1566706343",

"Ecological Modeling in Risk Assessment. Chemical Effects on Populations, Ecosystems, and Landscapes","risk + ecosystem","[Robert A. Pastorok, Steven M. Bartell, Scott Ferson, Lev R. Ginzburg]","[Technology & Engineering]","Toxic chemicals can exert effects on all levels of the biological hierarchy, from cells to organs to organisms to populations to entire ecosystems. However, most risk assessment models express their results in terms of effects on individual organisms, without corresponding information on how populations, groups of species, or whole ecosystems may respond to chemical stressors. Ecological Modeling in Risk Assessment: Chemical Effects on Populations, Ecosystems, and Landscapes takes a new approach by compiling and evaluating models that can be used in assessing risk at the population, ecosystem, and landscape levels. The authors give an overview of the current process of ecological risk assessment for toxic chemicals and of how modeling of populations, ecosystems, and landscapes could improve the status quo. They present a classification of ecological models and explain the differences between population, ecosystem, landscape, and toxicity-extrapolation models. The authors describe the model evaluation process and define evaluation criteria. Finally, the results of the model evaluations are presented in a concise format with recommendations on modeling approaches to use now and develop further. The authors present and evaluate various models on the basis of their realism and complexity, prediction of relevant assessment endpoints, treatment of uncertainty, regulatory acceptance, resource efficiency, and other criteria. They provide models that will improve the ecological relevance of risk assessments and make data collection more cost-effective. Ecological Modeling in Risk Assessment serves as a reference for selecting and applying the best models when performing a risk assessment.","2001-10-30","http://books.google.es/books?id=LNdRGbpDWgUC&printsec=frontcover&dq=risk+%2B+ecosystem&hl=&cd=5&source=gbs_api","1566705746",

"Environmental Pollution and Control","risk + ecosystem","[J. Jeffrey Peirce, P Aarne Vesilind, Ruth Weiner]","[Technology & Engineering]","Complex environmental problems are often reduced to an inappropriate level of simplicity. While this book does not seek to present a comprehensive scientific and technical coverage of all aspects of the subject matter, it makes the issues, ideas, and language of environmental engineering accessible and understandable to the nontechnical reader. Improvements introduced in the fourth edition include a complete rewrite of the chapters dealing with risk assessment and ethics, the introduction of new theories of radiation damage, inclusion of environmental disasters like Chernobyl and Bhopal, and general updating of all the content, specifically that on radioactive waste. Since this book was first published in 1972, several generations of students have become environmentally aware and conscious of their responsibilities to the planet earth. Many of these environmental pioneers are now teaching in colleges and universities, and have in their classes students with the same sense of dedication and resolve that they themselves brought to the discipline. In those days, it was sometimes difficult to explain what indeed environmental science or engineering was, and why the development of these fields was so important to the future of the earth and to human civilization. Today there is no question that the human species has the capability of destroying its collective home, and that we have indeed taken major steps toward doing exactly that. And yet, while, a lot has changed in a generation, much has not. We still have air pollution; we still contaminate our water supplies; we still dispose of hazardous materials improperly; we still destroy natural habitats as if no other species mattered. And worst of all, we still continue to populate the earth at an alarming rate. There is still a need for this book, and for the college and university courses that use it as a text, and perhaps this need is more acute now than it was several decades ago. Although the battle to preserve the environment is still raging, some of the rules have changed. We now must take into account risk to humans, and be able to manipulate concepts of risk management. With increasing population, and fewer alternatives to waste disposal, this problem is intensified. Environmental laws have changed, and will no doubt continue to evolve. Attitudes toward the environment are often couched in what has become known as the environmental ethic. Finally, the environmental movement has become powerful politically, and environmentalism can be made to serve a political agenda. In revising this book, we have attempted to incorporate the evolving nature of environmental sciences and engineering by adding chapters as necessary and eliminating material that is less germane to today's students. We have nevertheless maintained the essential feature of this book -- to package the more important aspects of environmental engineering science and technology in an organized manner and present this mainly technical material to a nonengineering audience. This book has been used as a text in courses which require no prerequisites, although a high school knowledge of chemistry is important. A knowledge of college level algebra is also useful, but calculus is not required for the understanding of the technical and scientific concepts. We do not intend for this book to be scientifically and technically complete. In fact, many complex environmental problems have been simplified to the threshold of pain for many engineers and scientists. Our objective, however, is not to impress nontechnical students with the rigors and complexities of pollution control technology but rather to make some of the language and ideas of environmental engineering and science more understandable.

"Ecosystem-Based Management for the Oceans","risk + ecosystem","[Karen McLeod, Heather Leslie]","[Science]","Conventional management approaches cannot meet the challenges faced by ocean and coastal ecosystems today. Consequently, national and international bodies have called for a shift toward more comprehensive ecosystem-based marine management. Synthesizing a vast amount of current knowledge, Ecosystem-Based Management for the Oceans is a comprehensive guide to utilizing this promising new approach. At its core, ecosystem-based management (EBM) is about acknowledging connections. Instead of focusing on the impacts of single activities on the delivery of individual ecosystem services, EBM focuses on the array of services that we receive from marine systems, the interactive and cumulative effects of multiple human activities on these coupled ecological and social systems, and the importance of working towards common goals across sectors. Ecosystem-Based Management for the Oceans provides a conceptual framework for students and professionals who want to understand and utilize this powerful approach. And it employs case studies that draw on the experiences of EBM practitioners to demonstrate how EBM principles can be applied to real-world problems. The book emphasizes the importance of understanding the factors that contribute to social and ecological resilience —the extent to which a system can maintain its structure, function, and identity in the face of disturbance.

"Ecosystem Ecology Research Trends","risk + ecosystem","[Junying Chen, Chuguang Guô]","[Nature]","Ecosystem ecology is the integrated study of biotic and abiotic components of ecosystems and their interactions within an ecosystem framework. This science examines how ecosystems work and relates this to their components such as chemicals, bedrock, soil, plants, and animals. A major focus of ecosystem ecology is on functional processes, ecological mechanisms that maintain the structure and services produced by ecosystems. These include primary productivity (production of biomass), decomposition, and trophic interactions. Studies of ecosystem function have greatly improved human understanding of sustainable production of forage, fibre, fuel, and provision of water. Functional processes are mediated by regional-to-local level climate, disturbance, and management thus ecosystem ecology provides a powerful framework for identifying ecological mechanisms that interact with global environmental problems, especially global warming and degradation of surface water. This book presents the latest developments in the field from around the world.","2008","http://books.google.es/books?id=AH9JghsCN0gC&pg=PA275&dq=risk+%2B+ecosystem&hl=&cd=22&source=gbs_api","1604561831",

Ecosystems of different types and scales are under increasing pressure due to natural and human induced changes. Climate change and the disasters it causes, are a major driver affecting ecosystems and services. Several studies have provided evidence that a healthy ecosystem helps in reducing the impacts of climate change and disasters. This book makes a case for ecosystem-based adaptation by arguing that ecosystems and its services are critical in the climate change and disaster risk reduction fields.

"Mitigating Selenium Ecotoxic Risk by Establishment of a Model Aquatic Ecosystem","risk + ecosystem","[Jennifer Bradford]",,"Irrigation practices in the western side of California's San Joaquin Valley result in water quality degradation due to the release of naturally occurring salts, selenium (Se) and other trace elements into the groundwater. The contaminated water is largely disposed of by discharge into terminal evaporation basins where subsequent concentration of Se can lead to toxic levels. The aim of this research was to reduce the ecotoxic risk associated with exposure to Se in wastewater collected in an Integrated on-Farm Drainage Management (IFDM) system. We proposed a bioremediation strategy to reduce total water Se through a combination of stimulating microalgal Se volatilization and harvesting brine shrimp (Artemia franciscana), which feed on the microalgae. Laboratory microcosm experiments examined the environmental conditions affecting the proposed bioremediation strategy and were performed concurrently with a 2 year pilot scale study to test the efficacy of the bioremediation strategy at Red Rock Ranch (RRR), a 640 acre farm that practices IFDM located in Five Points, CA. Molecular techniques were used to characterize the microalgal populations in regard to environmental inputs as well as uptake and volatilization of Se. The microalgal communities were profiled using specific 18S and16S rRNA-PCR primers along with Denaturing Gradient Gel Electrophoresis (DGGE). Total water, microalgal tissue and volatile Se was analyzed using a microdigestion method coupled with fluorescence detection. Chlorophyll a was used to assess microalgal abundance. Iron gluconate was preferred compared to other forms of iron supplement for supporting microalgal growth and water Se removal. A phosphorus concentration of 2mg/L was found to be sufficient to support microalgal growth. Optimal growing conditions for the microalgal cultures also included 60ppth salinity and a 16 hour photoperiod. Nitrate, however, had a negative impact on microalgal water Se removal and tissue Se accumulation. In addition, we found that microalgal volatilization is 7.5 fold greater at 30°C than 10°C and that brine shrimp can tolerate water Se concentrations greater than 42ppm. The 2 year pilot scale study at RRR revealed that brine shrimp and a diverse community of microalgae can survive in the high saline and Se conditions at RRR. Moreover, we established that Se bioremediation of RRR IFDM agricultural drainage water is possible through the combination of microalgal Se volatilization and brine shrimp harvest; an estimated minimum of 5.1% of the total water Se would be removed from the wastewater per year.","2009","http://books.google.es/books?id=sXn42IqJ8m4C&dq=risk+%2B+ecosystem&hl=&cd=28&source=gbs_api","1109179871",

This is the first book that explains how to perform ecological risk assessments and gives assessors access to the full range of useful data, models, and conceptual approaches they need to perform an accurate assessment. It explains how ecological risk assessment relates to more familiar types of assessments. It also shows how to organize and conduct an ecological risk assessment, including defining the source, selecting endpoints, describing the relevant features of the receiving environment, estimating exposure, estimating effects, characterizing the risks, and interacting with the risk manager. Specific technical topics include finding and selecting toxicity data; statistical and mathematical models of effects on organisms, populations, and ecosystems; estimation of chemical fate parameters; modeling of chemical transport and fate; estimation of chemical uptake by organisms; and estimation, propagation, and presentation of uncertainty. Ecological Risk Assessment also covers conventional risk assessments, risk assessments for existing contamination, large scale problems, exotic organisms, and risk assessments based on environmental monitoring. Environmental assessors at regulatory agencies, consulting firms, industry, and government labs need this book for its approaches and methods for ecological risk assessment. Professors in ecology and other environmental sciences will find the book's practical preparation useful for classroom instruction.

However, there is now wide recognition of the need to incorporate disaster risk management concerns in dealing with such phenomena. There is also a growing awareness of the necessity for a multi-sectoral approach in managing the effects of climate variability and climate change, since this can lead to a significant reduction of risk. This book presents the latest findings from scientific research on climate variation, climate change and their links with disaster risk management. It showcases projects and other initiatives in this field that are being undertaken in both industrialised and developing countries, by universities and scientific institutions, government bodies, national and international agencies, NGOs and other stakeholders.

"The Economics of Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services","risk + ecosystem","[Shunsuke Managi]","[Business & Economics]","Ecosystems and biodiversity have been degraded over decades due to human activities. One of the critical causes is market failure: the current market only accounts tangible resources and neglects intangible functions, such as climate control and natural hazard mitigation. Under such circumstances in capitalism, land conversion and resource exploitation, which generate financial income, are highly prioritised over conservation, which is not necessarily beneficial in monetary terms. To halt ecosystem degradation, thus, the values of ecosystem services need to be visualised and economic instruments for ecosystem conservation should be further developed. This book focuses on these two aspects and performs several studies, including valuation of ecosystem services, productivity analysis, institutional design of payment for ecosystem services (PES), impact assessment of reduction emission from deforestation and forest degradation (REDD), and economic experiment of mitigation banking scheme. From these analysis, economic values of ecosystem services are demonstrated from both supply and demand side, and the directions for improving economic instruments are indicated both directly and indirectly. As many of these analysis are usually conducted in the North America and Europe, this book is unique in geographical focus, namely, Japan, Asia and globe. Also, wide variety of ecosystems are targeted for studies; agricultural lands, forests, wetlands, and marine. Hence, this will be informative introduction for those who desire to study economics of biodiversity and ecosystem services in these regions and of these ecological zones.","2012-12-20","http://books.google.es/books?id=anNXwdRZy5YC&pg=PA195&dq=risk+%2B+ecosystem&hl=&cd=33&source=gbs_api","9781136224478",

Beinat]","[Business & Economics]","Environmental decisions must satisfy a multitude of objectives and the matching of a plan, policy or project to such objectives is a matter of both facts and value judgements. Value Functions for Environmental Management provides a systematic approach to the structuring and measurement of value judgements, showing how they drive the decision process and how to make them transparent and effective in support of complex decisions. The value functions that the book describes provide a scheme for the exploration of human values and a tool for transforming them into an analytical model. A clear statement can then be made of the degree to which a decision has achieved its objectives, and how conflicting objectives may be addressed. This does not mean that there is no role for human judgement in the process. Complexity, often coupled with large information gaps, necessitates expert judgement, but the values adopted by the experts are themselves capable of being structured and measured according to the value function methodology presented here, even if the judgements themselves are qualitative and tentative. Value models for expert panels are also presented. The use of the methodology in practice is illustrated by examples.

"Models in Ecosystem Science","risk + ecosystem","[Charles Draper William Canham, Jonathan Cole, William K.

They provide a logical structure that guides and informs empirical observations of ecosystem processes. They play a particularly crucial role in synthesizing and integrating our understanding of the immense diversity of ecosystem structure and function. Increasingly, models are being called on to predict the effects of human actions on natural ecosystems. Despite the widespread use of models, there exists intense debate within the field over a wide range of practical and philosophical issues pertaining to quantitative modeling. This book--which grew out of a gathering of leading experts at the ninth Cary Conference--explores those issues. The book opens with an overview of the status and role of modeling in ecosystem science, including perspectives on the long-running debate over the appropriate level of complexity in models. This is followed by eight chapters that address the critical issue of evaluating ecosystem models, including methods of addressing uncertainty. Next come several case studies of the role of models in environmental policy and management. A section on the future of modeling in ecosystem science focuses on increasing the use of modeling in undergraduate education and the modeling skills of professionals within the field. The benefits and limitations of predictive (versus observational) models are also considered in detail. Written by stellar contributors, this book grants access to the state of the art and science of ecosystem modeling.","2003","http://books.google.es/books?id=ffI9ICVl0GcC&pg=PA347&dq=risk+%2B+ecosystem&hl=&cd=38&source=gbs_api","0691092893",

The key task of risk characterization is to provide needed and appropriate information to decisionmakers and the public. This important new volume illustrates that making risks understandable to the public involves much more than translating scientific knowledge. The volume also draws conclusions about what society should expect from risk characterization and offers clear guidelines and principles for informing the wide variety of risk decisions that face our increasingly technological society. Understanding Risk Frames fundamental questions about what risk characterization means. Reviews traditional definitions and explores new conceptual and practical approaches. Explores how risk characterization should inform decisionmakers and the public. Looks at risk characterization in the context of the entire decisionmaking process. Understanding Risk discusses how risk characterization has fallen short in many recent controversial decisions. Throughout the text, examples and case studies--such as planning for the long-term ecological health of the Everglades or deciding on the operation of a waste incinerator--bring key concepts to life. Understanding Risk will be important to anyone involved in risk issues: federal, state, and local policymakers and regulators; risk managers; scientists; industrialists; researchers; and concerned individuals.","2003-07-15","http://books.google.es/books?id=2lE-O9JwL8kC&pg=PA168&dq=risk+%2B+ecosystem&hl=&cd=39&source=gbs_api","0309089565",

This carefully reasoned science and policy assessment shows thatthe commercialization and release of transgenic crops on millions of acres of farmland can poseserious -- and costly -- environmental risks. The authors propose a practical, feasible method ofconducting precommercialization evaluations that will balance the needs of ecological safety withthose of agriculture and business, and that will assist governments seeking to identify and protectagainst two of the most significant risks.Rissler and Mellon first define transgenic plants andreview research currently under way in the field of crop biotechnology. They then identify andcategorize the environmental risks presented by commercial uses of transgenic crops. These includethe potential of transgenic crops to become weeds or to produce weeds with transgene properties suchas herbicide resistance that may require costly control programs. Plants engineered to contain virusparticles may facilitate the creation of new viruses that can affect economically importantcrops.Looking at global seed trade, the authors discuss the relationship between commercial approvalin the United States and environmental risks abroad. Of particular concern is the flow of novelgenes into the centers of crop biodiversity, primarily in the developing world, that could threatenthe genetic base of the world's future food supply.The authors conclude by reviewing the currentstatus of U.S. regulations governing transgenic crops.

Each chapter of Demographic Toxicity describes the application of a population model to one species, with the aim of demonstrating how various life history characteristics of the species are incorporated into the model, how ecotoxicological impacts are modeled, and how the results of the model has been or can be used in risk assessment. The model in each chapter is implemented in RAMAS software, which uses matrix modeling of population dynamics. RAMAS software is believed to be the most powerful tool ever invented for this task.Demographic Toxicity includes a CD that contains a demo version of the program and the data files for each species. The book explains how to use these specific tools for modeling, analysis, and interpretation of data. Demographic Toxicity provides a major review of current knowledge on population dynamics in different species, representing both terrestrial and aquatic environments.","2008-03-28","http://books.google.es/books?id=aUBcpzi4NF4C&pg=PA54&dq=risk+%2B+ecosystems&hl=&cd=21&source=gbs_api","9780199715640",

The easier-said-than-done task of removing these deadly weapons, however, poses huge environmental problems. This book is the compendium of the workshop on the ""Ecological Risks Associated with the Destruction of Chemical Weapons"", hosted by the University of Lüneburg in October 2003, which brought the former enemies NATO and Russia together to discuss, reflect on, and exchange their experiences in the laudable mission of environmentally friendly disposal of chemical weapons. This four-day workshop received contributions from 57 experts from North America, Russia, and European countries. Most of them are recognized authorities in the field of chemical weapons disposal as well as in related fields. The speeches by those who share the burden of this terrible undertaking concentrated on cleaning up contaminated sites, the ethics, political and international law aspects of the destruction of chemical weapons, and on issues related to human health, pathogenesis, toxicity, and exposure to the polluted environment. Contributions were also made on lewisite detection, risk prevention, insurance, safety, monitoring of old chemical weapons destruction as well as public awareness for this problem.","2006-02-27","http://books.google.es/books?id=b4hbUMC54vAC&pg=PA55&dq=risk+%2B+ecosystems&hl=&cd=22&source=gbs_api","1402031351",

"Population-Level Ecological Risk Assessment","risk + ecosystems","[Lawrence W. Barnthouse, Wayne R. Munns, Jr., Mary T. Sorensen]","[Technology & Engineering]","Most ecological risk assessments consider the risk to individual organisms or organism-level attributes. From a management perspective, however, risks to population-level attributes and processes are often more relevant. Despite many published calls for population risk assessment and the abundance of available scientific research and technical tools assessing risks to populations, risk assessors worldwide still have difficulty determining how population level considerations can be integrated into environmental decision-making. Population-Level Ecological Risk Assessment establishes a framework for goals, methods, and data needs for different assessment applications and for integrating population-level risk assessment into risk management decisions. Beginning with a summary of legal, regulatory, business, and other contexts, the book presents population-level ecological risk assessment as an internationally recognized, science-based tool and offers specific recommendations for using this tool to support environmental management decisions. It gives clear, explicit, operational population assessment definitions and explains the relevance of density dependence, genetics, and spatial considerations, as well as applicable lessons from conservation biology and natural resource management. The authors provide a ""tool box"" of empirical and modeling methods and describe the general approaches, assumptions, data requirements, strengths, and limitations of each method. They establish a working foundation for designing and conducting population-level ecological risk assessments consistent with North American, European, and Japanese risk management approaches. The book concludes by highlighting key considerations needed to improve the scientific quality and interpretation of assessments. Detailed appendices include examples of population-level assessment approaches applicable to specific environmental management contexts, a modeling case study, and a supplemental reading list.","2007-09-25","http://books.google.es/books?id=hDWxArPGOXMC&pg=PA11&dq=risk+%2B+ecosystems&hl=&cd=26&source=gbs_api","9781420053333",

Shocks in one location or asset class can have a sizable impact on the stability of institutions and markets around the world. But systemic risk analysis is severely hampered by the lack of consistent data that capture the international dimensions of finance. While currently available data can be used more effectively, supervisors and other agencies need more and better data to construct even rudimentary measures of risks in the international financial system. Similarly, market participants need better information on aggregate positions and linkages to appropriately monitor and price risks. Ongoing initiatives that will help in closing data gaps include the G20 Data Gaps Initiative, which recommends the collection of consistent bank-level data for joint analyses and enhancements to existing sets of aggregate statistics, and the enhancement to the BIS international banking statistics.","2011-09-01","http://books.google.es/books?id=HqnRV2mPt5wC&printsec=frontcover&dq=risks+%2B+systemic&hl=&cd=3&source=gbs_api","1463945477",

Second, in all countries aggregate demand shocks are the main drivers of the real cycle, and bank credit demand shocks are the main drivers of the bank lending cycle.

"Modeling Correlated Systemic Liquidity and Solvency Risks in a Financial Environment with Incomplete Information","risks + systemic","[Liliana Schumacher, Theodore M. Barnhill, Jr.]","[Business & Economics]","This paper proposes and demonstrates a methodology for modeling correlated systemic solvency and liquidity risks for a banking system. Using a forward looking simulation of many risk factors applied to detailed balance sheets for a 10 bank stylized United States banking system, we analyze correlated market and credit risk and estimate the probability that multiple banks will fail or experience liquidity runs simultaneously. Significant systemic risk factors are shown to include financial and economic environment regime shifts to stressful conditions, poor initial loan credit quality, loan portfolio sector and regional concentrations, bank creditors' sensitivity to and uncertainties regarding solvency risk, and inadequate capital. Systemic banking system solvency risk is driven by the correlated defaults of many borrowers, other market risks, and inter-bank defaults. Liquidity runs are modeled as a response to elevated solvency risk and uncertainties and are shown to increase correlated bank failures. Potential bank funding outflows and contractions in lending with significant real economic impacts are estimated. Increases in equity capital levels needed to reduce bank solvency and liquidity risk levels to a target confidence level are also estimated to range from 3 percent to 20 percent of assets. for a future environment that replicates the 1987-2006 volatilities and correlations, we find only a small risk of U.S. bank failures focused on thinly capitalized and regionally concentrated smaller banks. for the 2007-2010 financial environment calibration we find substantially elevated solvency and liquidity risks for all banks and the banking system.","2011-11-01","http://books.google.es/books?id=3tyRjgGmX-QC&pg=PA25&dq=risks+%2B+systemic&hl=&cd=13&source=gbs_api","1463978332",
"Australia: Addressing Systemic Risk Through Higher Loss Absorbency—Technical Note","risks + systemic","[International Monetary Fund]","[Business & Economics]","Australia’s four largest banks can be considered domestically systemic. They make up the lion’s share of the banking system, use similar business models, and are interconnected. The top four banks are relatively similar in terms of systemic importance, partly reflecting the authorities’ ?four pillar? policy, which aims at preventing the number of large banks from falling below four. To deal with systemic risks, the authorities deploy a multi-pronged approach consisting of risk-based supervision, recovery and resolution planning, and conservative risk weights and definitions of loss absorbent capital. Most countries that have already identified strategies to deal with their systemic institutions incorporate higher loss absorbency for systemic institutions in their approach. Market based methodologies using the expected default frequency for systemic institutions can gauge the amount of additional capital—higher loss absorbency—required to reduce the probability of failure of systemic institutions to an acceptable level. Alternatively, the implied funding cost advantage can indicate the degree of systemic importance and be used to define higher capital requirements to offset this implicit subsidy. Application of these methods to Australian banks provides a range of estimates of higher loss absorbency requirements for systemic institutions and a transparent framework for discussion and selection of these requirements.","2012-11-21","http://books.google.es/books?id=B3rD-a5rQgsC&printsec=frontcover&dq=risks+%2B+systemic&hl=&cd=14&source=gbs_api","9781616358242",

"The Butterfly Defect. How Globalization Creates Systemic Risks, and What to Do about It","risks + systemic","[Ian Goldin, Mike Mariathasan]","[Political Science]","Global hyperconnectivity and increased system integration have led to vast benefits, including worldwide growth in incomes, education, innovation, and technology. But rapid globalization has also created concerns because the repercussions of local events now cascade over national borders and the fallout of financial meltdowns and environmental disasters affects everyone. The Butterfly Defect addresses the widening gap between systemic risks and their effective management. It shows how the new dynamics of turbo-charged globalization has the potential and power to destabilize our societies. Drawing on the latest insights from a wide variety of disciplines, Ian Goldin and Mike Mariathasan provide practical guidance for how governments, businesses, and individuals can better manage risk in our contemporary world. Goldin and Mariathasan assert that the current complexities of globalization will not be sustainable as surprises become more frequent and have widespread impacts. The recent financial crisis exemplifies the new form of systemic risk that will characterize the coming decades, and the authors provide the first framework for understanding how such risk will function in the twenty-first century. Goldin and Mariathasan demonstrate that systemic risk issues are now endemic everywhere—in supply chains, pandemics, infrastructure, ecology and climate change, economics, and politics. Unless we are better able to address these concerns, they will lead to greater protectionism, xenophobia, nationalism, and, inevitably, deglobalization, rising conflict, and slower growth. The Butterfly Defect shows that mitigating uncertainty and systemic risk in an interconnected world is an essential task for our future.","2014-05-11","http://books.google.es/books?id=zOiPAgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=risks+%2B+systemic&hl=&cd=18&source=gbs_api","9781400850204",

"Collateral, Netting and Systemic Risk in the OTC Derivatives Market (EPub)","risks + systemic","[Mr. Manmohan Singh]","[Business & Economics]","To mitigate systemic risk, some regulators have advocated the greater use of centralized counterparties (CCPs) to clear Over-The-Counter (OTC) derivatives trades. Regulators should be cognizant that large banks active in the OTC derivatives market do not hold collateral against all the positions in their trading book and the paper proves an estimate of this under-collateralization. Whatever collateral is held by banks is allowed to be rehypothecated (or re-used) to others. Since CCPs would require all positions to have collateral against them, off-loading a significant portion of OTC derivatives transactions to central counterparties (CCPs) would require large increases in posted collateral, possibly requiring large banks to raise more capital. These costs suggest that most large banks will be reluctant to offload their positions to CCPs, and the paper proposes an appropriate capital levy on remaining positions to encourage the transition.","2010-04-01","http://books.google.es/books?id=JIpd5zMZ__EC&pg=PT6&dq=risks+%2B+systemic&hl=&cd=30&source=gbs_api","9781452756097",
"The Risks of Financial Institutions","risks + systemic","[Mark Carey, René M. Stulz]","[Business & Economics]","Until about twenty years ago, the consensus view on the cause of financial-system distress was fairly simple: a run on one bank could easily turn to a panic involving runs on all banks, destroying some and disrupting the financial system. Since then, however, a series of events—such as emerging-market debt crises, bond-market meltdowns, and the Long-Term Capital Management episode—has forced a rethinking of the risks facing financial institutions and the tools available to measure and manage these risks. The Risks of Financial Institutions examines the various risks affecting financial institutions and explores a variety of methods to help institutions and regulators more accurately measure and forecast risk. The contributors--from academic institutions, regulatory organizations, and banking--bring a wide range of perspectives and experience to the issue. The result is a volume that points a way forward to greater financial stability and better risk management of financial institutions.","2007-11-01","http://books.google.es/books?id=mTWtpwkGYGgC&printsec=frontcover&dq=risks+%2B+systemic&hl=&cd=31&source=gbs_api","9780226092980",

In view of the limitations of available (private or official) insurance schemes, and the distortions introduced by central bank lending of last resort (LOLR), the authors favor decentralized liquid foreign asset requirements on dollar deposits, supplemented by a scheme of ""circuit breakers."" The latter combines the use of limited dollar liquidity to ensure the convertibility of transactional deposits with a mechanism that automatically limits the convertibility of dollar term deposits once triggered by a predetermined decline in banks' liquidity.","2005-09-01","http://books.google.es/books?id=JL4b_2WzOXUC&pg=PT71&dq=risks+%2B+systemic&hl=&cd=34&source=gbs_api","9781451994421",

As each day's headlines brought stories of bank failures and rescues, government policies drawn and redrawn against the backdrop of an historic Presidential election, and solutions that seemed to be discarded almost as soon as they were proposed, a group of thirty-three academics at New York University Stern School of Business began tackling the hard questions behind the headlines. Representing fields of finance, economics, and accounting, these professors-led by Dean Thomas Cooley and Vice Dean Ingo Walter-shaped eighteen independent policy papers that proposed market-focused solutions to the problems within a common framework. In December, with great urgency, they sent hand-bound copies to Washington. Restoring Financial Stability is the culmination of their work.

Subsidiary-based corporate structures benefit from greater protection against economic risk because of affiliate-level limited liability, but are more exposed to the risk of capital expropriation than are branches. Thus, branch-based structures are preferred to subsidiary-based structures when expropriation risk is high relative to economic risk, and vice versa. Greater cross-country risk correlation and more accurate pricing of risk by investors reduce the differences between the two structures. Furthermore, the corporate structure affects bank risk taking and affiliate size.","2010-02-01","http://books.google.es/books?id=_3B-h6SVZXoC&pg=PT27&dq=risks+%2B+structure&hl=&cd=11&source=gbs_api","9781452756103",

"Acceptable Risks. Politics, Policy, and Risky Technologies","risks + structure","[C. F.

Public agencies such as the Food and Drug Administration are told by political superiors not to inhibit important technological advances and may even be charged with promoting such development but must also make sure that no major accidents occur under their watch. Given the large costs associated with catastrophic accidents, the general public and elected officials often demand reliable or failure-free management of these technologies and have little tolerance for the error. /divDIVResearch in this area has lead to a schism between those who argue that it is possible to have reliable management techniques and safely manage complex technologies and others who contend that such control is difficult at best. In this book C. F. Larry Heimann advances an important solution to this problem by developing a general theory of organizational reliability and agency decision making. The book looks at both external and internal influences on reliability in agency decision making. It then tests theoretical propositions developed in a comparative case study of two agencies involved with the handling of risky technologies: NASA and the manned space flight program and the FDA's handling of pharmaceuticals--particularly new AIDS therapies. /divDIVDrawing on concepts from engineering, organizational theory, political science, and decision theory, this book will be of interest to those interested in science and technology policy, bureaucratic management and reform, as well as those interested in health and space policy. /divDIVC.

Perhaps because of its emphasis on matters of design, methodology, and quantitative analysis, criminology has had few significant advances in theory. Advances in Criminological Theory is the first series exclusively dedicated to the dissemination of original work on criminological theory. The Process and Structure of Crime, the ninth volume in this landmark series, is a thorough overview of the conceptual and empirical issues raised by the adoption of a criminal event perspective, which takes into account the multifaceted character of human behavior. This book is divided into three sections: conceptual bases of criminal events, the criminal event perspective itself, and responses to criminal events. Contributors analyze and explore a wide range of topics, including: how interpersonal routines are structured through past experience; the influence of social context on interpersonal routines; criminal opportunity and its impact on criminal events; the significance of neighborhood context; the effect of victimization and fear; how problem-oriented policing efforts need to be informed by and reflect the problems of repeat offenders, repeat victims, and hot spots of crime; and finally, how changes in the physical environment constrain or limit criminal opportunities. This fascinating work will be beneficial to criminologists, sociologists, and scholars of legal studies. Contributors to this volume include: Leslie W. Kennedy, Erin Gibbs Van Brunschot, Robert F.

This is mainly due to the growing concern about the future of mankind, but also to a greater awareness of the limited nature of our resources. People want to know what can go wrong. In the beginning terms such as risk, disaster, indeterminacy and uncertainty are discussed in detail in this book. Furthermore disasters and risks are categorized into natural, technical, health and social risks, and then major disasters in these categories are listed. Risk parameters are introduced to allow the objective description of risks. The explanation of risk parameters (such as mortalities, fatal accident rates, the family of F-N curves and the concept of lost life years) leads to the quality of life parameters as measurements of risk. In general this parameter permits the comparison of the efficiency of all safety measures over the entire human society. However, limitations of this concept are also disclosed. The book clearly shows the interdependence of risk measures. Safety and risks cannot be discussed only by looking at specific problems, since increasing safety in individual fields might lead to a decrease of safety over the entire society.","2008-07-24","http://books.google.es/books?id=cNKAM1LTIBUC&pg=PA160&dq=risks+%2B+structure&hl=&cd=28&source=gbs_api","9783540795551",

"Anticipating Risks and Organising Risk Regulation","risks + structure","[Bridget M. Hutter]","[Social Science]","Anticipating risks has become an obsession of the early twenty-first century. Private and public sector organisations increasingly devote resources to risk prevention and contingency planning to manage risk events should they occur. This 2010 book shows how we can organise our social, organisational and regulatory policy systems to cope better with the array of local and transnational risks we regularly encounter. Contributors from a range of disciplines - including finance, history, law, management, political science, social psychology, sociology and disaster studies - consider threats, vulnerabilities and insecurities alongside social and organisational sources of resilience and security. These issues are introduced and discussed through a fascinating and diverse set of topics, including myxomatosis, the 2012 Olympic Games, gene therapy and the financial crisis.

"In the Chamber of Risks. Understanding Risk Controversies","risks + structure","[William Leiss]","[Health & Fitness]","In In the Chamber of Risks William Leiss demonstrates that case studies of risk controversies show that those instincts are unreliable guides to effective risk management and that in all cases the opposite position is a far better guide. As risk management is inherently disputable, public perceptions of risk should be seen as legitimate and treated as such and the public should always be involved in discussions about risk evaluations made by scientists and risk managers. ; Leiss chronicles the erratic course of risk management and communication in environmental management in Canada, discussing the notable controversies that have arisen over pesticides and breast cancer, vinyl toys, genetically engineered food crops, cellular telephones, and antibiotic-resistant bacteria, among many others. He focuses on risk management – how we make decisions about and assess hazards in the environment – and on risk communication – social dialogue that deals with both our intuitive feelings of concern about substances or activities that might hurt our health or the environment, and the scientific and probabilistic description of them. ; Leiss shows that both risk management and risk communication, when properly constructed, require an elaborate process because the very things that can cause harm are in most cases the same things that bring us great benefits, such as paper mills, electricity from nuclear power generating stations, or wireless telecommunications. ;","2001","http://books.google.es/books?id=j86Ph9WSkGcC&pg=PA22&dq=risks+%2B+structure&hl=&cd=37&source=gbs_api","0773522468",

"Safety, Reliability and Risks Associated with Water, Oil and Gas Pipelines","risks + structure","[Guy Pluvinage, Mohamed Hamdy Elwany]","[Technology & Engineering]","Pipes are of major importance for transport of liquids and gas mainly for water, natural gas and oil. The total length of gas pipes in the world is estimated at one million kilometres for gas transport (pipes with a diameter of 80 to 1000 mm). Pipelines remain the least expensive transcontinental mean of transport compared to rail-bound or terrestrial transport. It has become increasingly paramount to ensure the safe utilisation of such plant in order to prevent economical, social and ecological losses. From a technical point of view, pipelines are complicated three dimensional structures that include straight pipes, nozzles, pipe-bends, dissimilar welded joints, etc. In addition, their operating conditions can be quite severe, that is, internal pressure and cyclic loading (vibration) combined with the influence of internal and external corrosive environments. The external defects, e.g., corrosion defects, gouge, foreign object scratches, and pipeline erection activities are major failure reasons of gas pipelines. All these types of defects and associated failure are described. Leak and fracture of pipes is assumed to be done by initiation and propagation of defect and final failure when defect has reached a critical length. In this book, the three two major defect assessment tools for pipes are presented : i) the failure assessment diagram and particularly the SINTAP procedure, ii) limit analysis, iii) strain design approach Methods of defect repair are based on investigation findings. Methods such as welded sleeve, repair clamp composite sleeve, grinding, pipe replacement are described.","2007-10-25","http://books.google.es/books?id=WV4c-HpDh5EC&pg=PA23&dq=risks+%2B+structure&hl=&cd=40&source=gbs_api","9781402065248",

"Introduction to Safety and Reliability of Structures","risks + structures","[Jörg Schneider]","[Reliability (Engineering)]","Structural engineers devote all their effort to meeting society¿s expectations efficiently. Engineers and scientists work together to develop solutions to structural problems. Given that nothing is absolutely and eternally safe, the goal is to attain an acceptably small probability of failure for a structure. Reliability analysis is part of the science and practice of engineering today, not only with respect to the safety of structures, but also for questions of serviceability and other requirements of technical systems that might be impacted by some probability. The present volume takes a rather broad approach to the safety of structures and related topics. It treats the underlying concepts of risk and safety and introduces the reader to the main concepts and strategies for dealing with hazards. A chapter is devoted to the processing of data into information that is relevant for applying reliability theory. The two main chapters deal with the modelling of structures and with methods of reliability analysis. Another chapter focuses on problems related to establishing target reliabilities, assessing existing structures, and on effective strategies against human error. The Appendix supports the application of the methods proposed and refers readers to a number of related computer programs.","2006","http://books.google.es/books?id=Mszw6-2PPP4C&pg=PA11&dq=risks+%2B+structures&hl=&cd=7&source=gbs_api","3857480939",

"Changing Social Risks and Social Policy Responses in the Nordic Welfare States","risks + structures","[Ivan Harsløf, Rickard Ulmestig]","[Business & Economics]","The Nordic welfare states have found themselves in the firing line of post-industrial developments, resulting in fundamental changes in societal institutions at all levels. In particular, changes in the labour market and family, reinforced by processes of migration and international market integration, have presented the welfare states with new social needs to attend to. This book critically explores responses to changing social risks across areas such as structural unemployment, entrepreneurship, immigration, single parenthood, education and health. It explores critical changes in the structure of the Nordic welfare states and the social policy strategies for alleviating social risks. While the Nordic countries are shining in most international comparisons, such changes and their wider implications have often been overlooked in the literature. The book raises the question whether certain risks are even being evoked actively through new social policies instating incentive structures concomitant with policy goals in order to encourage certain behaviour among citizens.","2013-10-30","http://books.google.es/books?id=rBVEAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA25&dq=risks+%2B+structures&hl=&cd=20&source=gbs_api","9781137267191",
"Life Settlements and Longevity Structures. Pricing and Risk Management","risks + structures","[Geoff Chaplin, Jim Aspinwall, Mark Venn]","[Business & Economics]","Recent turbulence in the financial markets has highlighted the need for diversified portfolios with lower correlations between the different investments. Life settlements meet this need, offering investors the prospect of high, stable returns, uncorrelated with the broader financial markets. This book provides readers of all levels of experience with essential information on the process surrounding the acquisition and management of a portfolio of life settlements; the assessment, modelling and mitigation of the associated longevity, interest rate and credit risks; and practical approaches to financing and risk management structures. It begins with the history of life insurance and looks at how the need for new financing sources has led to the growth of the life settlements market in the United States. The authors provide a detailed exploration of the mathematical formulae surrounding the generation of mortality curves, drawing a parallel between the tools deployed in the credit derivatives market and those available to model longevity risk. Structured products and securitisation techniques are introduced and explained, starting with simple vanilla products and models before illustrating some of the investment structures associated with life settlements. Capital market mechanisms available to assist the investor in limiting the risks associated with life settlement portfolios are outlined, as are opportunities to use life settlement portfolios to mitigate the risks of traditional capital markets. The last section of the book covers derivative products, either available now or under consideration, that will reduce or potentially eliminate longevity risks within life settlement portfolios. It then reviews hedging and risk management strategies and considers how to measure the effectiveness of risk mitigation.","2009-08-11","http://books.google.es/books?id=tay74Q1ZbpQC&pg=PT66&dq=risks+%2B+structures&hl=&cd=21&source=gbs_api","9780470741948",

Throughout the book, it is pointed out that there are actor-driven risks, namely those posed by international negotiations themselves, and issue-driven risks which are caused by large-scale human activities. In fact, negotiated risks deal with some of the most serious risks facing humanity: climate change, nuclear activities, and weapons of mass destruction. The book contains both scientific analyses on the nature of internationally negotiated risks and analyses of concrete risks, both of which are of immense practical relevance in the larger context of international negotiations.","2009-04-28","http://books.google.es/books?id=DKj2_9yXv_MC&pg=PA295&dq=risks+%2B+structures&hl=&cd=25&source=gbs_api","9783540929932",

"Top-Down Network Design","risks + network","[Priscilla Oppenheimer]","[Computers]","Objectives The purpose of Top-Down Network Design, Third Edition, is to help you design networks that meet a customer’s business and technical goals. Whether your customer is another department within your own company or an external client, this book provides you with tested processes and tools to help you understand traffic flow, protocol behavior, and internetworking technologies. After completing this book, you will be equipped to design enterprise networks that meet a customer’s requirements for functionality, capacity, performance, availability, scalability, affordability, security, and manageability. Audience This book is for you if you are an internetworking professional responsible for designing and maintaining medium- to large-sized enterprise networks. If you are a network engineer, architect, or technician who has a working knowledge of network protocols and technologies, this book will provide you with practical advice on applying your knowledge to internetwork design. This book also includes useful information for consultants, systems engineers, and sales engineers who design corporate networks for clients. In the fast-paced presales environment of many systems engineers, it often is difficult to slow down and insist on a top-down, structured systems analysis approach. Wherever possible, this book includes shortcuts and assumptions that can be made to speed up the network design process. Finally, this book is useful for undergraduate and graduate students in computer science and information technology disciplines. Students who have taken one or two courses in networking theory will find Top-Down Network Design, Third Edition, an approachable introduction to the engineering and business issues related to developing real-world networks that solve typical business problems. Changes for the Third Edition Networks have changed in many ways since the second edition was published. Many legacy technologies have disappeared and are no longer covered in the book. In addition, modern networks have become multifaceted, providing support for numerous bandwidth-hungry applications and a variety of devices, ranging from smart phones to tablet PCs to high-end servers. Modern users expect the network to be available all the time, from any device, and to let them securely collaborate with coworkers, friends, and family. Networks today support voice, video, high-definition TV, desktop sharing, virtual meetings, online training, virtual reality, and applications that we can’t even imagine that brilliant college students are busily creating in their dorm rooms. As applications rapidly change and put more demand on networks, the need to teach a systematic approach to network design is even more important than ever. With that need in mind, the third edition has been retooled to make it an ideal textbook for college students. The third edition features review questions and design scenarios at the end of each chapter to help students learn top-down network design. To address new demands on modern networks, the third edition of Top-Down Network Design also has updated material on the following topics: ¿ Network redundancy ¿ Modularity in network designs ¿ The Cisco SAFE security reference architecture ¿ The Rapid Spanning Tree Protocol (RSTP) ¿ Internet Protocol version 6 (IPv6) ¿ Ethernet scalability options, including 10-Gbps Ethernet and Metro Ethernet ¿ Network design and management tools","2010-08-24","http://books.google.es/books?id=-gybT60dWJsC&pg=PT117&dq=risks+%2B+network&hl=&cd=4&source=gbs_api","1587140012",
"Decision Making with the Analytic Network Process. Economic, Political, Social and Technological Applications with Benefits, Opportunities, Costs and Risks","risks + network","[Thomas L. Saaty, Luis G. Vargas]","[BUSINESS & ECONOMICS]","The Analytic Network Process (ANP), developed by Thomas Saaty in his work on multicriteria decision making, applies network structures with dependence and feedback to complex decision making. This new edition of Decision Making with the Analytic Network Process is a selection of the latest applications of ANP to economic, social and political decisions, and also to technological design. The ANP is a methodological tool that is helpful to organize knowledge and thinking, elicit judgments registered in both in memory and in feelings, quantify the judgments and derive priorities from them, and finally synthesize these diverse priorities into a single mathematically and logically justifiable overall outcome. In the process of deriving this outcome, the ANP also allows for the representation and synthesis of diverse opinions in the midst of discussion and debate. The book focuses on the application of the ANP in three different areas: economics, the social sciences and the linking of measurement with human values. Economists can use the ANP for an alternate approach for dealing with economic problems than the usual mathematical models on which economics bases its quantitative thinking. For psychologists, sociologists and political scientists, the ANP offers the methodology they have sought for some time to quantify and derive measurements for intangibles. Finally the book applies the ANP to provide people in the physical and engineering sciences with a quantitative method to link hard measurement to human values. In such a process, one is able to interpret the true meaning of measurements made on a uniform scale using a unit.","2013-05-14","http://books.google.es/books?id=wqaTlfJSwWkC&pg=PA81&dq=risks+%2B+network&hl=&cd=8&source=gbs_api","9781461472797",

"Quantifying and Controlling Catastrophic Risks","risks + network","[B. John Garrick]","[Technology & Engineering]","The perception, assessment and management of risk are increasingly important core principles for determining the development of both policy and strategic responses to civil and environmental catastrophes. Whereas these principles were once confined to some areas of activity i.e. financial and insurance, they are now widely used in civil and environmental engineering. Comprehensive and readable, Civil and Environmental Risk: Mitigation and Control, provides readers with the mathematical tools and quantitative methods for determining the probability of a catastrophic event and mitigating and controlling the aftermath. With this book engineers develop the required skills for accurately assessing risk and formulating appropriate response strategies. The two part treatment starts with a clear and rigorous exposition of the quantitative risk assessment process, followed by self-contained chapters concerning applications. One of the first books to address both natural and human generated disasters, topics include events such as pandemic diseases, climate changes, major hurricanes, super earthquakes, mega tsunamis, volcanic eruptions, industrial accidents and terrorist attacks. Case studies appear at the end of the book allowing engineers to see how these principles are applied to scenarios such as a super hurricane or mega tsunamis, a reactor core melt down in a nuclear plant, a terrorist attack on the national electric grid, and an abrupt climate change brought about by a change in the ocean currents in the North Atlantic. Written by the current Chairman of the U.S. Nuclear Waste Technical Review Board, Environmental risk managers will find this reference a valuable and authoritative guide both in accurately calculating risk and its applications in their work.

Behrman, Hans-Peter Kohler, Susan Cotts]","[Business & Economics]","Information about life-and-death matters such as ways to attain good health or prevent disease is often diffused through informal social networks. Network-based strategies and competencies are probably even more important in poor societies with limited means of communication and less effective formal structures than in developed economies. In this chapter, the authors explore the nature of and impacts of informal social networks in reducing fertility and HIV infection in Kenya and Malawi, using longitudinal quantitative and qualitative data that they and their collaborators have been collecting and analyzing for more than a decade. They find that social networks and informal interactions are relevant for many different health domains in developing countries. Their research shows that network effects may be nonlinear, that there may be multiple equilibria, and that networks may either reinforce the status quo or help diffuse new options and behaviors. They show that both the context (e.g., the degree of market development) and the density of networks matter (possibly interactively), as well as the endogeneity of network partners. Their work demonstrates that multiple approaches, including both qualitative and quantitative analyses, can be informative in providing greater understanding of what networks do and how they function.","2009-05-19","http://books.google.es/books?id=KagM_EzpXEEC&pg=PT25&dq=risks+%2B+network&hl=&cd=30&source=gbs_api","9780137015597",

"Network Security Assessment. Know Your Network","risks + network","[Chris McNab]","[Computers]","How secure is your network? The best way to find out is to attack it. Network Security Assessment provides you with the tricks and tools professional security consultants use to identify and assess risks in Internet-based networks-the same penetration testing model they use to secure government, military, and commercial networks. With this book, you can adopt, refine, and reuse this testing model to design and deploy networks that are hardened and immune from attack. Network Security Assessment demonstrates how a determined attacker scours Internet-based networks in search of vulnerable components, from the network to the application level. This new edition is up-to-date on the latest hacking techniques, but rather than focus on individual issues, it looks at the bigger picture by grouping and analyzing threats at a high-level. By grouping threats in this way, you learn to create defensive strategies against entire attack categories, providing protection now and into the future. Network Security Assessment helps you assess: Web services, including Microsoft IIS, Apache, Tomcat, and subsystems such as OpenSSL, Microsoft FrontPage, and Outlook Web Access (OWA) Web application technologies, including ASP, JSP, PHP, middleware, and backend databases such as MySQL, Oracle, and Microsoft SQL Server Microsoft Windows networking components, including RPC, NetBIOS, and CIFS services SMTP, POP3, and IMAP email services IP services that provide secure inbound network access, including IPsec, Microsoft PPTP, and SSL VPNs Unix RPC services on Linux, Solaris, IRIX, and other platforms Various types of application-level vulnerabilities that hacker tools and scripts exploit Assessment is the first step any organization should take to start managing information risks correctly.

"Coping with Uncertainty. Robust Solutions","risks + networks","[Kurt Marti, Marek Makowski]","[Psychology]","Support for addressing the on-going global changes needs solutions for new scientific problems which in turn require new concepts and tools. A key issue concerns a vast variety of irreducible uncertainties, including extreme events of high multidimensional consequences, e.g., the climate change. The dilemma is concerned with enormous costs versus massive uncertainties of extreme impacts. Traditional scientific approaches rely on real observations and experiments. Yet no sufficient observations exist for new problems, and ""pure"" experiments, and learning by doing may be expensive, dangerous, or impossible. In addition, the available historical observations are often contaminated by past actions, and policies. Thus, tools are presented for the explicit treatment of uncertainties using ""synthetic"" information composed of available ""hard"" data from historical observations, the results of possible experiments, and scientific facts, as well as ""soft"" data from experts' opinions, and scenarios.","2010","http://books.google.es/books?id=PYICFxSHalsC&pg=PA101&dq=risks+%2B+networks&hl=&cd=28&source=gbs_api","9783642037351",

Field, Vicente Barros, Thomas F. Stocker, Qin Dahe]","[Science]","This Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Special Report (IPCC-SREX) explores the challenge of understanding and managing the risks of climate extremes to advance climate change adaptation. Extreme weather and climate events, interacting with exposed and vulnerable human and natural systems, can lead to disasters. Changes in the frequency and severity of the physical events affect disaster risk, but so do the spatially diverse and temporally dynamic patterns of exposure and vulnerability. Some types of extreme weather and climate events have increased in frequency or magnitude, but populations and assets at risk have also increased, with consequences for disaster risk. Opportunities for managing risks of weather- and climate-related disasters exist or can be developed at any scale, local to international. Prepared following strict IPCC procedures, SREX is an invaluable assessment for anyone interested in climate extremes, environmental disasters and adaptation to climate change, including policymakers, the private sector and academic researchers.","2012-05-28","http://books.google.es/books?id=Sc8hAwAAQBAJ&pg=PA309&dq=risks+%2B+networks&hl=&cd=34&source=gbs_api","9781107380103",
"Wireless Operational Security","risks + networks","[John Rittinghouse, PhD, CISM, James F. Ransome, PhD, CISM, CISSP]","[Computers]","This comprehensive wireless network book addresses the operational and day-to-day security management requirements of 21st century companies. Wireless networks can easily be reconfigured, are very mobile, allow for potentially nonstop exposure, and require the level of security be scrutinized even more than for wired networks. This includes inherent security flaws in various wireless architectures that result in additional risks to otherwise secure converged wired networks. An even worse scenario is one where an insecure wireless network is connected to a weakly secured or insecure wired network and the wireless subnet is not separated from the wired subnet. There are approximately a dozen popular books that cover components of the architecture, design, theory, issues, challenges, and recommended policies for wireless security, none of which address them in a practical, operationally-oriented and comprehensive way. Wireless Operational Security bridges this gap. *Presents a new ""WISDOM"" model for Wireless Security Infrastructures *Acts as a critical guide to implementing ""Converged Networks"" wired/wireless with all necessary security considerations *Rittinghouse's Cybersecurity Operations Handbook is the only security book recommended by the FCC","2004-05-01","http://books.google.es/books?id=IcYFTPPbgEgC&pg=PA181&dq=risks+%2B+networks&hl=&cd=36&source=gbs_api","0080521193",
"Building DMZs For Enterprise Networks","risks + networks","[Syngress]","[Computers]","This book covers what an administrator needs to plan out and integrate a DMZ into a network for small, medium and Enterprise networks. In most enterprises the perception is that a firewall provides a hardened perimeter. However, the security of internal networks and hosts is usually very soft. In such an environment, a non-DMZ system that is offering services to the Internet creates the opportunity to leapfrog to other hosts in the soft interior of your network. In this scenario your internal network is fair game for any attacker who manages to penetrate your so-called hard perimeter. - There are currently no books written specifically on DMZs - This book will be unique in that it will be the only book that teaches readers how to build a DMZ using all of these products: ISA Server, Check Point NG, Cisco Routers, Sun Servers, and Nokia Security Appliances. - Dr. Thomas W.

"The Multifaith Movement: Global Risks and Cosmopolitan Solutions. Global Risks and Cosmopolitan Solutions","risks + networks","[Anna Halafoff]","[BODY, MIND & SPIRIT]","""This book documents the ultramodern rise of the multifaith movement, as mulitfaith initiatives have been increasingly deployed as cosmopolitan solutions to counter global risks such as terrorism and climate change at the turn of the 21st century. These projects aim to enhance common security, particularly in Western societies following the events of September 11, 2001 and the July 2005 London bombings, where multifaith engagement has been promoted as a strategy to counter violent extremism. The author draws on interviews with 56 leading figures in the field of multifaith relations, including Paul Knitter, Eboo Patel, Marcus Braybrooke, Katherine Marshall, John Voll and Krista Tippett. Identifying the principle aims of the multifaith movement, the analysis explores the benefits-and challenges-of multifaith engagement, as well as the effectiveness of multifaith initiatives in countering the process of radicalization. Building on notions of cosmopolitanism, the work proposes a new theoretical framework termed 'Netpeace', which recognizes the interconnectedness of global problems and their solutions.In doing so, it acknowledges the capacity of multi-actor peacebuilding networks, including religious and state actors, to address the pressing dilemmas of our times. The primary intention of the book is to assist in the formation of new models of activism and governance, founded on a 'politics of understanding' modeled by the multifaith movement""--Résumé de l'éditeur.","2012-10-29","http://books.google.es/books?id=aYQDV7TPMhIC&pg=PA169&dq=risks+%2B+networks&hl=&cd=38&source=gbs_api","9789400752108",

"Ecosystem Response Modelling in the Murray-Darling Basin","risks + ecosystem","[Neil Saintilan, Ian Overton]","[Science]","Ecosystem Response Modelling in the Murray-Darling Basin provides an overview of the status of science in support of water management in Australia’s largest and most economically important river catchment, and brings together the leading ecologists working in the rivers and wetlands of the Basin. It introduces the issues in ecosystem response modelling and how this area of science can support environmental watering decisions. The declining ecological condition of the internationally significant wetlands of the Murray-Darling Basin has been a prominent issue in Australia for many years. Several high profile government programs have sought to restore the flow conditions required to sustain healthy wetlands, and this book documents the scientific effort that is underpinning this task. In the Southern Murray-Darling Basin, the River Murray, the Murrumbidgee River and their associated wetlands and floodplains have been the focus of the Murray-Darling Basin Authority’s ‘The Living Murray’ program, and the NSW Rivers Environmental Restoration Program. The book documents research aimed at informing environmental water use in a number of iconic wetlands including those along the Murray – the Barmah-Millewa Forest; the Chowilla Floodplain and Lindsay-Wallpolla Islands; the Coorong and Murray mouth; and the Murrumbidgee – the Lowbidgee Floodplain. Within the Northern Murray-Darling Basin, research conducted in support of the Wetland Recovery Plan and the NSW Rivers Environmental Restoration Program has improved our knowledge of the Gwydir Wetlands and the Macquarie Marshes, and the water regimes required to sustain their ecology.","2010-04-27","http://books.google.es/books?id=lJTTfrx_jNIC&pg=PA406&dq=risks+%2B+ecosystem&hl=&cd=18&source=gbs_api","9780643101920",

Most textbooks on natural resource and ecosystem management are dominated by a steady-state view that interprets change as gradual and incremental and disregards interactions across scales. Management implementation of steady-state theory and policies tends to invest in controlling a few selected ecosystem processes, at the expense of long-term social-ecological resilience i.e., the capacity of the system to cope with surprise and abrupt changes. Loss of resilience makes systems more vulnerable to both expected and unforeseen changes. Achieving desirable outcomes for humanity, such as those of the UN Millennium Development Goals on poverty, food security, and environmental sustainability, will require new integrated and adaptive approaches to social and economic development, where the complex interconnectedness between humans and nature, at all scales, is considered and the existence of uncertainty and surprise accepted as the rule. The purpose of this textbook is to provide a new framework for resource management a framework based on the necessity of managing resources in a world dominated by uncertainty and change. The book links recent advances in the theory of resilience, sustainability, and vulnerability with practical issues of resource management.","2009-06-12","http://books.google.es/books?id=98_0Tgfd25kC&pg=PA59&dq=risks+%2B+ecosystem&hl=&cd=23&source=gbs_api","0387730338",

It concluded that recent trends in ecosystem change threatened human wellbeing due to declining ecosystem services. This bleak prophecy has galvanized conservation organizations, ecologists, and economists to work toward rigorous valuations of ecosystem services at a spatial scale and with a resolution that can inform public policy. The editors have assembled the world's leading scientists in the fields of conservation, policy analysis, and resource economics to provide the most intensive and best technical analyses of ecosystem services to date. A key idea that guides the science is that the modelling and valuation approaches being developed should use data that are readily available around the world. In addition, the book documents a toolbox of ecosystem service mapping, modeling, and valuation models that both The Nature Conservancy and the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) are beginning to apply around the world as they transform conservation from a biodiversity only to a people and ecosystem services agenda. The book addresses land, freshwater, and marine systems at a variety of spatial scales and includes discussion of how to treat both climate change and cultural values when examining tradeoffs among ecosystem services.","2011-04-07","http://books.google.es/books?id=dAU0YMB_rdEC&pg=PT801&dq=risks+%2B+ecosystem&hl=&cd=28&source=gbs_api","9780191621031",

"Assessing Forest Ecosystem Health in the Inland West","risks + ecosystem","[R Neil Sampson, David L Adams]","[Nature]","Assessing Forest Ecosystem Health in the Inland West is a thorough reference for policymakers, resource managers, environmentalists, students, and anyone interested in using ecosystem management as a tool to address forest health problems in the Inland West. The book provides the reader with a survey of current conditions in the Inland West, their historical origins, assessments of available management tools, and analyses of the various choices available to policymakers. Its goal is to help people understand the Inland West forests so that public policies can reflect a constructive and realistic framework in which forests can be managed for sustained health. This resource is the product of a scientific workshop where 35 participants, including scientists, resource managers, administrators, and environmentalists, addressed the forest health problem in the Inland West. Synthesis chapters integrate the diverse knowledge and experience which participants brought to the workshop. They identify and link together many of the ecological, social, and administrative conditions which have created the forest health problem in the West. The book is unique in that it reflects a process that fostered the use of academic research, field realities, and industrial knowledge to define an interdisciplinary problem, establish rational policy objectives, and set-up “do-able” management approaches. The following topics are analyzed: Assessing forest ecosystem health in the Inland West Historical and anticipated changes in forest ecosystems in the Inland West Defining and measuring forest health Historical range of variability as a tool for evaluating ecosystem change Administrative barriers to implementing forest health problems Economic and social dimensions of the forest health problem Fire management Ecosystem and landscape management Assessing Forest Ecosystem Health in the Inland West will help facilitate sound resource planning because it brings together the problems facing the Inland West from an interdisciplinary perspective.

"Systemic Management: Sustainable Human Interactions with Ecosystems and the Biosphere","risks + ecosystems","[Charles W. Fowler]","[Science]","'Systemic management' describes a holistic, objective and universally applicable form of management, providing a framework for addressing environmental challenges such as global warming, emergent diseases, deforestation, overpopulation, the extinction crisis, pollution, over-fishing, and habitat destruction. Its goals are the consistently sustainable relationships between humans and ecosystems, between humans and other species, and between humans and the biosphere. This book presents a convincing argument that these goals, and the means to achieve them, can be inferred from empirical information. It describes how comparisons between humans and other species reveal patterns that can serve to guide management toward true sustainability i.e. ways that are empirically observed to work in natural systems. This objective approach has rarely been possible in conventional management because sustainability is invariably undermined by conflicting human values. 'Systemic management' is presented as a specialized process of pattern-based decision-making that avoids the inconsistency, subjectivity and error in current management practice. It clearly demonstrates how mimicking nature's empirical examples of sustainability can circumvent anthropocentric tendencies to overuse/misuse human values in management, and illustrates the science best suited for achieving sustainability through examples of research that address specific management questions.","2009-03-26","http://books.google.es/books?id=sYbwKPaZTq8C&pg=PA101&dq=risks+%2B+ecosystems&hl=&cd=8&source=gbs_api","9780191580031",

For years now, ecotoxicological studies have tended to focus on one toxicant at a time. But that isn't how an ecosystem encounters toxicants (or stresses): there may be several elements at work in the air, several more in the water, and still more already within the soil of any given ecosystem, and all have some level of toxic influence on that ecosystem. Multiple Stresses in Ecosystems presents the state-of-the-art in determining the effects of these multiple impacts upon ecosystems. Resulting from a vanguard conference originally held in 1993 at UC Davis, this new work is divided into three sections that present methodolgies for assessing the health of an ecosystem; the effects of multiple toxicological impacts upon an ecosystem, and which tools are worth using to assess these dangers. Environmental scientists, chemists, toxicologists, risk analysts, and probably the entire membership of SETAC will find need for this book, as will wetlands scientists, ecologists, and research biologists.","1998-01-29","http://books.google.es/books?id=Q9NA3O3Lk5cC&pg=PA116&dq=risks+%2B+ecosystems&hl=&cd=9&source=gbs_api","1566703093",

"Novel Ecosystems. Intervening in the New Ecological World Order","risks + ecosystems","[Richard J. Hobbs, Eric S. Higgs, Carol Hall]","[Nature]","Land conversion, climate change and species invasions are contributing to the widespread emergence of novel ecosystems, which demand a shift in how we think about traditional approaches to conservation, restoration and environmental management. They are novel because they exist without historical precedents and are self-sustaining. Traditional approaches emphasizing native species and historical continuity are challenged by novel ecosystems that deliver critical ecosystems services or are simply immune to practical restorative efforts. Some fear that, by raising the issue of novel ecosystems, we are simply paving the way for a more laissez-faire attitude to conservation and restoration. Regardless of the range of views and perceptions about novel ecosystems, their existence is becoming ever more obvious and prevalent in today’s rapidly changing world. In this first comprehensive volume to look at the ecological, social, cultural, ethical and policy dimensions of novel ecosystems, the authors argue these altered systems are overdue for careful analysis and that we need to figure out how to intervene in them responsibly. This book brings together researchers from a range of disciplines together with practitioners and policy makers to explore the questions surrounding novel ecosystems. It includes chapters on key concepts and methodologies for deciding when and how to intervene in systems, as well as a rich collection of case studies and perspective pieces. It will be a valuable resource for researchers, managers and policy makers interested in the question of how humanity manages and restores ecosystems in a rapidly changing world.

"Ecosystems and Human Well-being. Health Synthesis","risks + ecosystems","[Millennium Ecosystem Assessment (Program)]","[Medical]","This report synthesizes the findings from the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment (MA) global and sub-global assessments of how ecosystem changes do or could affect human health and well-being. Over the past 50 years humans have changed natural ecosystems more rapidly and extensively than any comparable period in human history. The findings provide the strongest evidence so far of the ways in which pressures on ecosystems have resulted in the loss of vital ecosystem services which purify and replenish water soil and air resources essential to health and also keep many diseases in check. Loss of these ecosystem services in turn affect patterns of communicable and non-communicable disease distribution and transmission. In the future, still-increasing pressures on ecosystems could impact public health in a variety of ways that are unpredictable and potentially severe. Human exploitation of ecosystem services has indeed contributed to substantial net gains in well-being and development across much of the planet. Still not all regions and groups of people have benefited from this process and many have been harmed. Moreover the full costs associated with these gains are only now becoming apparent. Approximately 60% of the ecosystem services examined, from regulation of air quality to purification of water, are being degraded or used unsustainably. The Millennium Ecosystem Assessment has worked to assess the consequences of ecosystem change for human well-being and establish the scientific basis for actions needed to enhance the conservation and sustainable use of those systems so that they can continue to supply the services that underpin all aspects of human life. The assessment exercise has involved more than 1 300 experts worldwide and started in 2001.","2005-01-01","http://books.google.es/books?id=vKIXu2Z-9QsC&pg=PA27&dq=risks+%2B+ecosystems&hl=&cd=39&source=gbs_api","9789241563093",

"Quantifying Systemic Risk","risky + systemic","[Joseph G. Haubrich, Andrew W. Lo]","[Business & Economics]","In the aftermath of the recent financial crisis, the federal government has pursued significant regulatory reforms, including proposals to measure and monitor systemic risk. However, there is much debate about how this might be accomplished quantitatively and objectively—or whether this is even possible. A key issue is determining the appropriate trade-offs between risk and reward from a policy and social welfare perspective given the potential negative impact of crises. One of the first books to address the challenges of measuring statistical risk from a system-wide persepective, Quantifying Systemic Risk looks at the means of measuring systemic risk and explores alternative approaches. Among the topics discussed are the challenges of tying regulations to specific quantitative measures, the effects of learning and adaptation on the evolution of the market, and the distinction between the shocks that start a crisis and the mechanisms that enable it to grow.","2013-01-24","http://books.google.es/books?id=hFkrVCz92cIC&pg=PA110&dq=risky+%2B+systemic&hl=&cd=2&source=gbs_api","0226319288",

Shapo]","[Law]","Experimenting With The Consumer exposes the hazards of the mass-market experimentation in which every American consumer and worker is unwittingly tapped for product risk data by manufacturers, scientists, and regulators. Vioxx, Heparin, Avandia, Paxil, fen-phen, estrogens, silicone implants, pacemakers, formaldehyde in FEMA trailers, 60 buckyballs in coatings ... the headlines are increasingly filled with hidden risks coming to light in popular products years after federal agencies approve them for the American public. Shapo shows readers how to get past unreasonable trust or fear and make the best risk-management choices for themselves and their families. He walks them through what questions to ask before consenting to be in a clinical trial; how to evaluate the implied bold-print claims against the small-print disclosures in advertisements for medical products; how to uncover product and environmental risks in their homes, workplaces, supermarkets, and neighborhoods; how to assess and control product risk while maximizing consumer choice and benefit; how to pressure government to tighten consumer protection; and how to seek legal redress. Through a diverse selection of dramatic case studies, Shapo lays bare the incentives of companies and entrepreneurial scientists to fake or obscure experimental data before and after government approval; the fights between interested and disinterested scientists over data; the fights between scientists and doctors over patient rights; the campaigns of activists against government agencies to release experimental drugs; the impact of the journalistic and promotional media on public knowledge and perception of product risk; and the marketing tricks that manufacturers use to harness sexual desire to product launches and to shape the prescription choices of physicians.","2008-12-30","http://books.google.es/books?id=VoVfwfe339oC&pg=PA68&dq=risky+%2B+systemic&hl=&cd=7&source=gbs_api","9780313365294",

Current macroprudential policy and surveillance (MPS) efforts are aimed establishing a regulatory framework that helps mitigate the risk from systemic linkages with a view towards enhancing the resilience of the financial sector. This paper presents a forward-looking framework (""Systemic CCA"") to measure systemic solvency risk based on market-implied expected losses of financial institutions with practical applications for the financial sector risk management and the system-wide capital assessment in top-down stress testing. The suggested approach uses advanced contingent claims analysis (CCA) to generate aggregate estimates of the joint default risk of multiple institutions as a conditional tail expectation using multivariate extreme value theory (EVT). In addition, the framework also helps quantify the individual contributions to systemic risk and contingent liabilities of the financial sector during times of stress.","2013-02-27","http://books.google.es/books?id=XhbYslQUfAgC&pg=PR18&dq=risky+%2B+systemic&hl=&cd=11&source=gbs_api","9781475557534",

Black Box Casino: How Wall Street's Risky Shadow Banking Crashed Global Finance provides an accurate and understandable explanation, compiling and interpreting mountains of evidence to provide clear analysis and insight into the crisis that traumatized people and institutions around the globe. The book provides a thorough, in-depth examination of the multiple contributing factors. The author goes back as far as 15 years before the crisis to show how the well-intentioned idea of providing home ownership prompted a government led effort to steadily weaken credit standards. He assigns partial blame on regulators that were unaware of growing levels of risk, ignored mounting evidence of a housing bubble, and failed to grasp the unintended consequences of certain regulations.

"Risky Lessons. Sex Education and Social Inequality","risky + systemic","[Jessica Fields]","[Social Science]","Curricula in U.S. public schools are often the focus of heated debate, and few subjects spark more controversy than sex education. While conservatives argue that sexual abstinence should be the only message, liberals counter that an approach that provides comprehensive instruction and helps young people avoid sexually transmitted diseases and pregnancy is necessary. Caught in the middle are the students and teachers whose everyday experiences of sex education are seldom as clear-cut as either side of the debate suggests.Risky Lessons brings readers inside three North Carolina middle schools to show how students and teachers support and subvert the official curriculum through their questions, choices, viewpoints, and reactions. Most important, the book highlights how sex education's formal and informal lessons reflect and reinforce gender, race, and class inequalities.Ultimately critical of both conservative and liberal approaches, Fields argues for curricula that promote social and sexual justice. Sex education's aim need not be limited to reducing the risk of adolescent pregnancies, disease, and sexual activity. Rather, its lessons should help young people to recognize and contend with sexual desires, power, and inequalities.","2008-06-03","http://books.google.es/books?id=ue7cZs-kz3IC&pg=PA163&dq=risky+%2B+systemic&hl=&cd=21&source=gbs_api","9780813544991",

Yet, despite the exceedingly diverse range of publications that have sought to explain the causes and the logic of the crisis, central questions have remained unanswered. Indeed, not only has systemic risk become a buzzword, but it has also developed into an acute threat. But what exactly constitutes the very essence of this concept, and ought it to be considered an economic or a political phenomenon? In addressing these questions, this volume draws upon political economy as an approach to analyze the concept of systemic risk as well as corresponding dilemmas of political order, legitimacy, and expertise. The resulting discussion posits major consequences for the political governance of financial systems in the increasingly interconnected world of the twenty-first century.","2013-09","http://books.google.es/books?id=jTbJAAAAQBAJ&pg=PA92&dq=risky+%2B+systemic&hl=&cd=23&source=gbs_api","9783593399881",

The first part of the book presents the theoretical foundation of the yoyo model and its empirical justifications. The author then shows how to use the model to address and resolve several problems in scientific areas, such as Newtonian physics, planetary motions, and the three-body problem, as well as economics and finance, such as Becker’s rotten kid theorem. The following part discusses the structure of human thoughts, infinity problems in the system of modern mathematics, and the fourth crisis of mathematics. The book concludes with a section on the concept of rolling currents, which can help predict weather changes, especially the arrival of disastrous weather conditions. Focusing on complex, unresolved issues in modern science, this book thoroughly explains the novel yoyo model and how it can be used to better understand wage differentials, weather patterns, and more.","2008-12-22","http://books.google.es/books?id=viBg3DcP3-8C&pg=PA246&dq=risky+%2B+systemic&hl=&cd=24&source=gbs_api","9781420088212",

Recent events suggest that older models of systemic shocks might no longer capture all of the possible paths of such disturbances or account for the increasing complexity of the financial system. To help assess these concerns, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and the NRC cosponsored a conference that brought together engineers, scientists, economists, and financial market experts to promote better understanding of systemic risk in a variety of fields.

"Systemic Implications of Transatlantic Regulatory Cooperation and Competition","risky + systemic","[Simon J. Evenett, Robert M. Stern, Robert Mitchell Stern]","[Business & Economics]","Regulations and enforcement decisions that at first appear to have only a domestic impact can have substantial spillover effects on other nations' economies. Experience has shown time and again that there is no reason to expect that these effects are confined to jurisdictions at the same level of development. Governments on both sides of the Atlantic recognize this, yet their responses in many policy areas are not aligned — sometimes deliberately so. This creates a complex regulatory landscape that appears to be the product of both cooperation and competition, and which can only be fully understood by looking through a number of disciplinary lenses. Drawing on some of the best legal, economic and political science expertise from both sides of the Atlantic, as well as on the knowledge of officials and private practitioners with experience in both industrialized and developing countries, this timely book assesses the systemic, global implications of transatlantic regulatory cooperation and competition. Insights from thematic papers are integrated with those from sector-specific analyses, and a rich set of implications for policymakers, business and civil society is offered.","2011","http://books.google.es/books?id=aBEqkLNn1-wC&pg=PA26&dq=risky+%2B+systemic&hl=&cd=28&source=gbs_api","9789812838483",

"Systemic Structure Behind Human Organizations. From Civilizations to Individuals","risky + systemic","[Yi Lin, Bailey Forrest]","[Business/Management Science, general]","Systemic Structure behind Human Organizations: From Civilizations to Individuals shows how the systemic yoyo model can be successfully employed to study human organizations at three different levels: civilizations, business enterprises, and individuals. This monograph tackles managerial problems from an holistic perspective such as how a business entity grows and dies and how a CEO can manipulate the choices of long- and short-term projects in order to gain more control over the board of directors. By creating a uniform language and logic of reasoning, the book provides examples and convincing results. Additionally the book shows how the same model, thinking logic, and methodology of the systems research can be equally applied to analyze problems and situations considered in natural sciences, social sciences, and humanity areas. Therefore it offers knowledge of a brand new tool to attack organizational problems. By concentrating on difficult, unsettled issues in these varying areas, this monograph thoroughly explains how some laws of nature can be established for the common study of natural and social sciences.","2011-12-15","http://books.google.es/books?id=B9eqmWnCcSsC&pg=PA260&dq=risky+%2B+systemic&hl=&cd=31&source=gbs_api","9781461423119",

Foreign subsidiaries located in politically risky countries have significantly more debt than do other foreign affiliates of the same parent companies. American firms further limit their equity exposures in politically risky countries by sharing ownership with local partners and by serving foreign markets with exports rather than local production. The residual political risk borne by parent companies leads them to use less domestic leverage, resulting in lower firm-wide leverage. Multinational firms with above-average exposures to politically risky countries have 8.4 percent less domestic leverage than do other firms.

Based on Ukrainian womens experiences in the Polish domestic work sector, it presents a new approach to analyse movements of female migrants responding to the demand for household labour around the world. Risks involved in migration and in migrant domestic work are accounted for in detail alongside an analysis of the migration decision-making processes. This study shows how social ties and migrant institutions effectively reduce the otherwise radical asymmetry of power between an individual migrant, the state and an employer. A Risky Business? brings to light the complex risk structures of migrants activities and their sophisticated responses to them. With their innovative strategies, migrants challenge government-imposed constraints and thus reduce the risks of migration.","2015-12-15","http://books.google.es/books?id=GBIhAwAAQBAJ&pg=PA49&dq=risky+%2B+structure&hl=&cd=4&source=gbs_api","9789048514472",

Each of these types of trust is examined by a leading scholar and compared with the expectations of neo-Darwinian theory, in particular the theories of kin selection and ethnic nepotism. The result is a fascinating, theoretically focused yet empirically eclectic contribution to the overlapping fields of human ethnology, evolutionary psychology, and bio-politics. The common thread uniting these diverse phenomena is a trusting relationship predicated on altruism. Chapters examine the strengths and limits of human trust under various stressers and temptations to defect. By exploring the relationship between kin and ethnic altruism and showing its sensitivity to culture,Risky Transactionsrecasts the evolutionary approach to ethnicity as a blend of primordial and instrumental factors.","2002","http://books.google.es/books?id=PwdegV06vuwC&pg=PA59&dq=risky+%2B+structure&hl=&cd=8&source=gbs_api","1571817107",

Four key interlinking themes emerge from the chapters. The first is how, within a neoliberal context, risk agendas can be used to justify and normalise the rationing and targeting of services. The second theme shows how the use of such agendas can in themselves redefine what is constituted as social problems, and how they are understood and responded to. Thirdly, welfare practice itself is being re-structured and re-theorised to adapt and conform to the new definitions and understandings that risk thinking has brought about. Finally, the fourth theme is how the use of risk as a negative organising discourse is not inevitable but, in different contexts, can create positive outcomes for service users, practitioners and society.","2013-08-02","http://books.google.es/books?id=pfozAAAAQBAJ&pg=PP75&dq=risky+%2B+structure&hl=&cd=13&source=gbs_api","9781137276094",

"Risky Rivers. The Economics and Politics of Floodplain Farming in Amazonia","risky + structure","[Michael Chibnik]","[Social Science]","While anthropologists and ecologists have carefully described the activities of the slash-and-burn cultivators, ranchers, and miners of tropical South America, they have largely overlooked the economic strategies and political struggles of riverine people who survive by flood-recession agriculture and fishing. These ribere¤os, who constitute the majority of the inhabitants of the Amazonian floodplains of Peru, have developed ecologically sustainable resource management practices that enable them to cope with periodic inundations of their fields by ""risky rivers."" They have, however, suffered greatly from unpredictable crop prices and erratic state agricultural policies. Michael Chibnik here examines the household economies, cultural ecology, grassroots political organizations of ribere¤os living in three floodplain villages near Iquitos, Peru. He describes the villagers' remarkable history, their participation in misconceived development programs, and their longstanding conflicts with regional elites. Chibnik discusses the political ecology of the region in the context of arguments about appropriate development policies in tropical lowlands. Although ribere¤os practice intensive agriculture with low environmental impact, they have not been able to improve their economic circumstances in recent years. Chibnik's study is a significant and timely contribution to current debates about the possibility of sustainable, equitable development in Amazonia.","1994-01-01","http://books.google.es/books?id=egnW8u_-2QUC&pg=PA227&dq=risky+%2B+structure&hl=&cd=24&source=gbs_api","0816514828",

"Mathematical Finance. Theory, Modeling, Implementation","risky + structure","[Christian Fries]","[Mathematics]","A balanced introduction to the theoretical foundations and real-world applications of mathematical finance The ever-growing use of derivative products makes it essential for financial industry practitioners to have a solid understanding of derivative pricing. To cope with the growing complexity, narrowing margins, and shortening life-cycle of the individual derivative product, an efficient, yet modular, implementation of the pricing algorithms is necessary. Mathematical Finance is the first book to harmonize the theory, modeling, and implementation of today's most prevalent pricing models under one convenient cover. Building a bridge from academia to practice, this self-contained text applies theoretical concepts to real-world examples and introduces state-of-the-art, object-oriented programming techniques that equip the reader with the conceptual and illustrative tools needed to understand and develop successful derivative pricing models. Utilizing almost twenty years of academic and industry experience, the author discusses the mathematical concepts that are the foundation of commonly used derivative pricing models, and insightful Motivation and Interpretation sections for each concept are presented to further illustrate the relationship between theory and practice. In-depth coverage of the common characteristics found amongst successful pricing models are provided in addition to key techniques and tips for the construction of these models. The opportunity to interactively explore the book's principal ideas and methodologies is made possible via a related Web site that features interactive Java experiments and exercises. While a high standard of mathematical precision is retained, Mathematical Finance emphasizes practical motivations, interpretations, and results and is an excellent textbook for students in mathematical finance, computational finance, and derivative pricing courses at the upper undergraduate or beginning graduate level. It also serves as a valuable reference for professionals in the banking, insurance, and asset management industries.","2007-10-19","http://books.google.es/books?id=q7c8Pi6QGFQC&pg=PA157&dq=risky+%2B+structure&hl=&cd=28&source=gbs_api","0470179775",

"Microfinance Games","risky + structure",,"[Game theory]","""Microfinance has been heralded as an effective way to address imperfections in credit markets. But from a theoretical perspective, the success of microfinance contracts has puzzling elements. In particular, the group-based mechanisms often employed are vulnerable to free-riding and collusion, although they can also reduce moral hazard and improve selection. The authors created an experimental economics laboratory in a large urban market in Lima, Peru and over seven months conducted 11 different games that allow them to unpack microfinance mechanisms in a systematic way. They find that risk-taking broadly conforms to predicted patterns, but that behavior is safer than optimal. The results help to explain why pioneering microfinance institutions have been moving away from group-based contracts.

"The Volatility Machine. Emerging Economies and the Threat of Financial Collapse","risky + structure","[Michael Pettis]","[Business & Economics]","This book presents a radically different argument for what has caused, and likely will continue to cause, the collapse of emerging market economies. Pettis combines the insights of economic history, economic theory, and finance theory into a comprehensive model for understanding sovereign liability management and the causes of financial crises. He examines recent financial crises in emerging market countries along with the history of international lending since the 1820s to argue that the process of international lending is driven primarily by external events and not by local politics and/or economic policies. He draws out the corporate finance implications of this approach to argue that most of the current analyses of the recent financial crises suffered by Latin America, Asia, and Russia have largely missed the point. He then develops a sovereign finance model, analogous to corporate finance, to understand the capital structure needs of emerging market countries. Using this model, he finally puts into perspective the recent crises, a new sovereign liability management theory, the implications of the model for sovereign debt restructurings, and the new financial architecture. Bridging the gap between finance specialists and traders, on the one hand, and economists and policy-makers on the other, The Volatility Machine is critical reading for anyone interested in where the international economy is going over the next several years.","2001","http://books.google.es/books?id=HYtf8NL7W_YC&pg=PA38&dq=risky+%2B+structure&hl=&cd=37&source=gbs_api","0195143302",
"Stress Ecology. Environmental Stress as Ecological Driving Force and Key Player in Evolution","risky + structure","[Christian Steinberg]","[Medical]","Not all stress is stressful; instead, it appears that stress in the environment, below the mutation threshold, is essential for many subtle manifestations of population structures and biodiversity, and has played a substantial role in the evolution of life. Intrigued by the behavior of laboratory animals that contradicted our current understanding of stress, the author and his group studied the beneficial effects of stress on animals and plants. The seemingly crazy animals demonstrated that several stress paradigms are outdated and have to be reconsidered.The book describes the general stress responses in microorganisms, plants, and animals to abiotic and biotic, to natural and anthropogenic stressors. These stress responses include the activation of oxygen, the biotransformation system, the stress proteins, and the metal-binding proteins. The potential of stress response lies in the transcription of genes, whereas the actual response is manifested by proteins and metabolites. Yet, not all stress responses are in the genes: micro-RNAs and epigenetics play central roles. Multiple stressors, such as environmental realism, do not always act additively; they may even diminish one another. Furthermore, one stressor often prepares the subject for the next one to come and may produce extended lifespans and increased offspring numbers, thus causing shifts in population structures.This book provides the first comprehensive analysis of the ecological and evolutionary effects of stress.","2012-02-02","http://books.google.es/books?id=97SBE_-l--oC&pg=PA327&dq=risky+%2B+structure&hl=&cd=38&source=gbs_api","9400720726",

I also document that government control of a corporation or audit by a reputable firm do not help to decrease tax evasion or stealing. I find a positive relationship between income diversion and debt financing: one standard deviation of my stealing/evasion measure is correlated to a 20%--25% increase of leverage. One possible explanation is that in case of income diversion, debt holders are better protected through a bankruptcy mechanism.","2008","http://books.google.es/books?id=VcqLKVGemWIC&pg=PA20&dq=risky+%2B+structure&hl=&cd=40&source=gbs_api","0549450556",

On the Empirical Failure of Expected Utility","risky + structures","[Daniel Friedman, Rabbi Assistant Professor of Neurology Assistant Professor of Neurology Assistant Professor of Neurology Daniel Friedman, R. Mark Isaac, Duncan James, Shyam Sunder]","[Business & Economics]","For several decades, the orthodox economics approach to understanding choice under risk has been to assume that each individual person maximizes some sort of personal utility function defined over purchasing power. This new volume contests that even the best wisdom from the orthodox theory has not yet been able to do better than supposedly naïve models that use rules of thumb, or that focus on the consumption possibilities and economic constraints facing the individual. The authors assert this by first revisiting the origins of orthodox theory. They then recount decades of failed attempts to obtain meaningful empirical validation or calibration of the theory. Estimated shapes and parameters of the ""curves"" have varied erratically from domain to domain (e.g., individual choice versus aggregate behavior), from context to context, from one elicitation mechanism to another, and even from the same individual at different time periods, sometimes just minutes apart. This book proposes the return to a simpler sort of scientific theory of risky choice, one that focuses not upon unobservable curves but rather upon the potentially observable opportunities and constraints facing decision makers. It argues that such an opportunities-based model offers superior possibilities for scientific advancement. At the very least, linear utility – in the presence of constraints - is a useful bar for the ""curved"" alternatives to clear.","2014-02-05","http://books.google.es/books?id=pHbMAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA121&dq=risky+%2B+structures&hl=&cd=23&source=gbs_api","9781317821243",

"Risky Marriage. HIV and Intimate Relationships in Tanzania","risky + structures","[Melissa Browning]","[Religion]","Given that women and girls carry the heaviest burdens of the African HIV pandemic, their lived experiences should be the starting point for any pedagogy of prevention. In light of this claim, Risky Marriage: HIV and Intimate Relationships in Tanzania uses qualitative fieldwork with HIV positive women living in Mwanza, Tanzania to ask why marriage is an HIV risk factor. By beginning with women’s experience as a hermeneutical lens, this book seeks to establish a creative space where African women can imagine new alternatives to HIV prevention that would promote human flourishing and abundant life in African communities. The aim of this book is to listen faithfully to the lived experiences of HIV positive women and ask how their experiences can help us re-imagine Christian conceptions of marriage, sexual ethics, and health in an HIV positive world. By drawing on the unwritten texts of women’s lives, this study proposes alternative pedagogies for faith-based prevention methods and contributes to the wider interdisciplinary and theo-ethical discourse on HIV prevention and women’s health. At the same time, it makes local impact of equal importance as women in East African communities are invited to think creatively about ways to end the HIV pandemic.

Burcharth, Barbara Zanuttigh, Alberto Lamberti]","[Technology & Engineering]","The effect of manmade activities is primarily local but can extend far away from the location of intervention. This underlines the importance of establishing coastal zone management plans covering large stretches of coastlines. In recent years, interest in Low Crested Structures (coastal defense structures with a low-crest) has been growing together with awareness of the sensitivity to environmental impacts produced by coastal defenses. The relation between wave climate, beach erosion, beach defence means, habitat changes and beach value, which clearly exists based on EC research results, suggests the necessity of an integrated approach when designing coastal protection schemes. In accordance with this need, the present design guidelines cover structure stability and construction problems, hydro and morphodynamic effects, environmental effects (colonisation of the structure and water quality), societal and economic impacts (recreational benefits, swimming safety, beach quality). Environmental Design Guidelines for Low Crested Coastal Structures is specifically dedicated to Low Crested Structures, and provides methodological tools both for the engineering design of structures and for the prediction of performance and environmental impacts of such structures. A briefing of current best practice for local and national planning authorities, statutory agencies and other stakeholders in the coastal zone is also covered. Presented in a generic way, this book is appropriate throughout the European Union, taking into account current European Commission policy and directives for the promotion of sustainable development and integrated coastal zone management. * Fills the gap between engineering and ecology in coastal defense planning * Shows the reader how to perform an integrated design of coastal defense schemes * Presents latest insights on hydro-morphodynamics induced by structures * Provides directly applicable tools for the design of low crested structures * Highlights socio-economic perspectives in coastal defense design","2010-07-07","http://books.google.es/books?id=fCNC9s2M8lEC&pg=PA52&dq=risky+%2B+structures&hl=&cd=39&source=gbs_api","0080555829",

"Emotions and Risky Technologies","risky + network","[Sabine Roeser]","[Philosophy]","By offering an innovative and challenging approach to the topic of risk and emotion, this book covers completely new territory. It focuses on risk and emotion from the perspective of moral philosophy and emphasizes that emotions are an important source of moral knowledge. The book connects to important debates about risk and emotion in empirical decision theory. However, whereas in these debates, emotions are mainly seen as a threat for rational decision making, this book investigates the novel idea that emotions might be a normative guide in making judgments about morally acceptable risks. Technological risks such as cloning, GM-foods, and nuclear energy spark heated and emotional debates. Many people are afraid of the possible unwanted consequences of such technologies. This gives rise to the following normative question: do we need emotions in order to be able to judge whether a technology and its concomitant risks are morally acceptable? This question has direct practical implications: should engineers, scientists and policy makers involved in developing risk regulation take emotions (of the public, but also their own) seriously or not? This book sets the stage for research into moral emotions and risky technologies. It brings together leading scholars who work in the areas of risk perception, moral emotions, and ethics of risk, and lets them reflect on this exciting and important new topic. The book should be of interest for everybody involved with risk regulation, both at an academic and a practical level.","2010-07-16","http://books.google.es/books?id=9eSErZUziCgC&pg=PA137&dq=risky+%2B+network&hl=&cd=16&source=gbs_api","9048186471",

"Infectious Disease Informatics and Biosurveillance","risky + network","[Daniel Zeng, Hsinchun Chen, Carlos Castillo-Chavez, William B. Lober, Mark Thurmond]","[Medical]","This book on Infectious Disease Informatics (IDI) and biosurveillance is intended to provide an integrated view of the current state of the art, identify technical and policy challenges and opportunities, and promote cross-disciplinary research that takes advantage of novel methodology and what we have learned from innovative applications. This book also fills a systemic gap in the literature by emphasizing informatics driven perspectives (e.g., information system design, data standards, computational aspects of biosurveillance algorithms, and system evaluation). Finally, this book attempts to reach policy makers and practitioners through the clear and effective communication of recent research findings in the context of case studies in IDI and biosurveillance, providing hands-on in-depth opportunities to practitioners to increase their understanding of value, applicability, and limitations of technical solutions. This book collects the state of the art research and modern perspectives of distinguished individuals and research groups on cutting-edge IDI technical and policy research and its application in biosurveillance. The contributed chapters are grouped into three units. Unit I provides an overview of recent biosurveillance research while highlighting the relevant legal and policy structures in the context of IDI and biosurveillance ongoing activities. It also identifies IDI data sources while addressing information collection, sharing, and dissemination issues as well as ethical considerations. Unit II contains survey chapters on the types of surveillance methods used to analyze IDI data in the context of public health and bioterrorism. Specific computational techniques covered include: text mining, time series analysis, multiple data streams methods, ensembles of surveillance methods, spatial analysis and visualization, social network analysis, and agent-based simulation. Unit III examines IT and decision support for public health event responseand bio-defense. Practical lessons learned in developing public health and biosurveillance systems, technology adoption, and syndromic surveillance for large events are discussed. The goal of this book is to provide an understandable interdisciplinary IDI and biosurveillance reference either used as a standalone textbook or reference for students, researchers, and practitioners in public health, veterinary medicine, biostatistics, information systems, computer science, and public administration and policy.","2010-11-16","http://books.google.es/books?id=SC9nEO_13pEC&pg=PA345&dq=risky+%2B+network&hl=&cd=19&source=gbs_api","9781441968920",

"Television Today and Tomorrow : It Won't Be What You Think. It Won't Be What You Think","risky + network","[Gene F. Jankowski, David C. Fuchs]","[Business & Economics]","In recent years, the media has been awash in exuberant tales of the arrival of the information superhighway, when television will explode with exciting possibilities, offering some 500 channels as well as a marriage of TV and computer that will provide, on command, access to the latest movies, magazines, newspapers, books, sports events, stock exchange figures, your bank account, and much, much more. And the major TV networks, pundits add, will be doomed to extinction by this revolution in cable, computers, and fiber optics. But in Television Today and Tomorrow, Gene Jankowski--former President and Chairman of the CBS Broadcast Group--and David Fuchs--also a former top executive at CBS--tell a different story. They predict a bumpy road ahead for the information superhighway, and the major networks, they say, are abundantly healthy and will remain so well into the next century. The information superhighway, Jankowski and Fuchs admit, will dramatically increase the distribution channels, but it will have little impact on the amount of programming created--and this may spell disaster. The authors show how the networks began as a way to provide programs to local stations (who could not afford to produce their own), who in turn provided the distribution that gave networks access to mass audiences and ultimately large advertising dollars. They then offer us an inside look at television production--showing us, for instance, a veteran scriptwriter putting together a breakfast table scene for ""Cloud Nine""--to underscore how much effort goes into producing just two minutes of primetime programming. They reveal that the present 20 channels require some 20,000 hours of programming each year, which is more than all the Broadway plays produced in this century, and they conclude that without a dramatic increase in programming (which won't happen if only because of the very finite supply of talent), the superhighway will be jammed bumper-to-bumper with reruns, old movies, and inexpensive programming aimed at tightly focused audiences (""narrowcasting"" as opposed to ""broadcasting""). This is hardly the bonanza the pundits have promised. The authors point out that the media blitz about the new technology has hardly focused on programming, or on funding, or on what needs these 500 channels will fill. The major networks, on the other hand, will remain the only means of reaching the whole country, and the only channels that offer a full schedule of current, live, and original programs, free of charge. And thus they will continue to attract most of the audience of TV viewers. The real loser in the cable revolution, the authors contend, is PBS, whose role as an alternative to network TV has been usurped by cable stations such as The Discovery Channel and Nickelodeon. This is a brass tacks look at television with an eye on the bottom line by two men who boast over sixty years of experience in the medium. If you want to understand television in America, where it came from and where it is going, you will need to read this book.","1995-05-25","http://books.google.es/books?id=CkPAkBRxP00C&pg=PA58&dq=risky+%2B+network&hl=&cd=23&source=gbs_api","0195344413",

"Neighbor Networks: Competitive Advantage Local and Personal","risky + network","[Ronald S. Burt]","[Business & Economics]","There is a moral to this book, a bit of Confucian wisdom often ignored in social network analysis: ""Worry not that no one knows you, seek to be worth knowing."" This advice is contrary to the usual social network emphasis on securing relations with well-connected people. Neighbor Networks examines the cases of analysts, bankers, and managers, and finds that rewards, in fact, do go to people with well-connected colleagues. Look around your organization. The individuals doing well tend to be affiliated with well-connected colleagues. However, the advantage obvious to the naked eye is misleading. It disappears when an individual's own characteristics are held constant. Well-connected people do not have to affiliate with people who have nothing to offer. This book shows that affiliation with well-connected people adds stability but no advantage to a person's own connections. Advantage is concentrated in people who are themselves well connected. This book is a trail of argument and evidence that leads to the conclusion that individuals make a lot of their own network advantage. The social psychology of networks moves to center stage and personal responsibility emerges as a key theme. In the end, the social is affirmed, but with an emphasis on individual agency and the social psychology of networks. The research gives new emphasis to Coleman's initial image of social capital as a forcing function for human capital. This book is for academics and researchers of organizational and network studies interested in a new angle on familiar data, and as a supplemental reading in graduate courses on social networks, stratification, or organizations. A variety of research settings are studied, and diverse theoretical perspectives are taken. The book's argument and evidence are supported by ample appendices for readers interested in background details.","2010-01-14","http://books.google.es/books?id=wbfLJvn2fkwC&pg=PR142&dq=risky+%2B+network&hl=&cd=28&source=gbs_api","9780191610097",
"Risky Business. Sharing Health Data While Protecting Privacy","risky + network","[Khaled El Emam]","[Law]","Due to the digitization of medical records, more and more health data is readily available. This dynamic has created many opportunities to unlock this information and use it to improve medical practice, and through research and surveillance understand the effectiveness and side effects of drugs and medical devices to ultimately improve the public's health. This data can also be used for commercial purposes such as sales and marketing. However, this newfound utility raises some profound questions about how this data ought to be used and how it will impact personal privacy. Unless we are able to address these privacy issues in a convincing and defensible way, there will be increased breaches of personal privacy. This will provoke regulators to impose new rules limiting the use and disclosure of health data for secondary purposes, patients increasingly to adopt privacy protective behaviours because they no longer trust how their health information is being managed, or healthcare providers to be reluctant to share their patients' data. By adopting responsible data sharing practices, researchers, companies and the general public can gain the benefits and the promise of big data analytics without sacrificing personal privacy or infringing upon law or regulation. Risky Business - Sharing Health Data While Protecting Privacy illustrates how this goal can be achieved. Bringing articles from a diverse collection of health data experts to inform the reader on contemporary policy, legal and technical issues surrounding health information privacy and data sharing. It is a uniquely practical work to inform the reader on how best - and how not to - share health data in the US and Canada.","2013-02","http://books.google.es/books?id=D91RR3dDlr0C&pg=PA49&dq=risky+%2B+network&hl=&cd=29&source=gbs_api","9781466980501",

"Risky Business. Rock in Film","risky + network","[R. Serge Denisoff, William D. Romanowski]","[Language Arts & Disciplines]","Exposure is the name of the game in the world of mass media today. Customers are more selective about what they purchase, in part because prices are higher, and in part because they have so many choices about how to spend leisure time. In the exposure of popular music, and in particular rock, the role of motion pictures has become increasingly significant. Rock music and film is the subject of this major new book reexamining and extending Denisoffs pioneering examinations of the record industry and how it interacts with other media. Prior to ""Saturday Night Fever, ""rock music had a limited role in the motion picture business. That movie's success, and the success of its soundtrack, began to change things. But it was not until 1983, with ""Flashdance, ""that the situation drastically changed; in 1984, ten soundtracks were certified platinum, many in the pop/rock genre. Clearly the marriage of movies with rock had reached maturity. Choosing which rock scores to discuss in this book became a challenging task. Selecting scores from ""The Graduate, Easy Rider, American Grafitti, Saturday Night Fever, Help!, ""and ""Dirty Dancing ""was easy. But many productions are significant not because of success, but because of their boxoffice and record store failures, and these too are discussed. ""Risky Business ""chronicles an important development, the interaction of two major mediums of mass culture in the latter twentieth century.

"Risky Rhetoric. AIDS and the Cultural Practices of HIV Testing","risky + networks","[J. Blake Scott]","[Health & Fitness]","Risky Rhetoric: AIDS and the Cultural Practices of HIV Testing is the first book-length study of the rhetoric inherent in and surrounding HIV testing. In addition to providing a history of HIV testing in the United States from 1985 to the present, J. Blake Scott explains how faulty arguments about testing’s power and effects have promoted unresponsive and even dangerous testing practices for so-called normal subjects as well as those deemed risky. Drawing on classical rhetoric as well as Michel Foucault’s theorizing of the examination as a form of disciplinary power, this study explores how HIV testing functions as a disciplinary technology that shapes subjects and exerts power over individual bodies and populations. Testing has largely been deployed to protect those defined as normal members of the general population by detecting, managing, and even punishing those diagnosed as risky (e.g., gay and bisexual men, poor women of color). But Scott reveals that testing’s function of protection-through-detection has been fueled in part by faulty arguments that exaggerate testing’s interventive power and benefits. These arguments have also created a perception that testing is a magic bullet. By overestimating the benefits of HIV testing and overlooking its contingencies and harmful effects, dominant arguments about testing have enabled a shortsighted public health response to HIV and unresponsive testing policies. The ultimate goal of Risky Rhetoric: AIDS and the Cultural Practices of HIV Testing is to offer strategies to policymakers, HIV educators and test counselors, and other rhetors for developing more responsive and egalitarian testing-related rhetorics and practices.","2003-01-01","http://books.google.es/books?id=1LkP7C1yoywC&pg=PA22&dq=risky+%2B+networks&hl=&cd=13&source=gbs_api","0809324946",

"Risky Genes. Genetics, Breast Cancer, and Jewish Identity","risky + networks","[Jessica Mozersky]","[Medical]","Ashkenazi Jews have the highest known population risk of carrying specific mutations in the high-risk breast cancer genes, BRCA1 and BRCA2. So what does it mean to be told you have an increased risk of genetic breast cancer because you are of Ashkenazi Jewish origin? In a time of ever-increasing knowledge about variations in genetic disease risk among different populations, there is a pressing need for research regarding the implications of such information for members of high-risk populations. Risky Genes provides first-hand intimate descriptions of women’s experiences of being Jewish and of being at increased risk of genetic breast cancer. It explores the impact this knowledge has on their identity and understanding of belonging to a collective. Using qualitative data from high-risk Ashkenazi women in the UK, this book elucidates the importance of biological discourses in forging Jewish self-identity and reveals the complex ways in which biological and social understandings of Jewish belonging intersect. In Risky Genes, Jessica Mozersky reflects upon and offers new insight into the ongoing debates regarding the implications of genetic research for populations, and of new genetic knowledge for individual and collective identity. The book will be of interest to students and scholars of sociology, anthropology, Jewish studies, medical genetics, medical ethics, religious studies, and race and ethnic studies.","2012-08-06","http://books.google.es/books?id=WdC7RZy-cPEC&pg=PA49&dq=risky+%2B+networks&hl=&cd=22&source=gbs_api","9780415502283",

It examines comparatively various forms of collaboration, ranging from consortia to multiparty joint ventures and from franchising to dealerships. Collaboration among firms of different sizes helps to overcome numerousweaknesses of the modern western industrial systems. It permits the governing of vertical disintegration without increasing fragmentation and transaction costs and allows firms to benefit from resource complementarities, favoring division of labour. The contributing authors, primarily focusing on Europe and the US, address important ways in which legal systems provide a framework for inter-firm coordination. It is clear from the analysis that significant obstacles to collaboration still remain, and the authors call for legal reforms at European and Member States level.","2011-01-01","http://books.google.es/books?id=vHi5Cgct6-kC&pg=PA45&dq=risky+%2B+networks&hl=&cd=26&source=gbs_api","9781849809696",
"Social Networks in Youth and Adolescence","risky + networks","[John Cotterell]","[Family & Relationships]","This thoroughly revised new edition looks at the nature of social networks, their changing configurations, and the forces of influence they unleash in shaping the life experiences of young people between the ages of 12 and 25 years. The author draws on both social and psychological research to apply network thinking to the social relations of youth across the domains of school, work and society. Network thinking examines the pattern and nature of social ties, and analyses how networks channel information, influence and support with effects on a wide range of life experiences. The book comprises eleven chapters, which contain discussion on key topics, such as youth transitions, network analysis, friendship, romantic ties, peer victimization, antisocial behaviour, youth risk-taking, school motivation, career influence, youth citizenship, and community organizations for young people. Chapters contain discussions of practical ways in which schools can provide support, and suggestions for youth organizations on how to assist young people to become effective citizens.","2007","http://books.google.es/books?id=_oK2bVXb4DoC&pg=PA127&dq=risky+%2B+networks&hl=&cd=27&source=gbs_api","9780415359498",

"Relational, Networked and Collaborative Approaches to Public Diplomacy. The Connective Mindshift","risky + networked","[R.S. Zaharna, Amelia Arsenault, Ali Fisher]","[Political Science]","Over the past decade, scholars, practitioners, and leading diplomats have forcefully argued for the need to move beyond one-way, mass-media-driven campaigns and develop more relational strategies. In the coming years, as the range of public diplomacy actors grows, the issues become more complexly intertwined, and the use of social media proliferates, the focus on relations will intensify along with the demands for more sophisticated strategies. These changes in the international arena call for a connective mindshift: a shift from information control and dominance to skilled relationship management. Leading international scholars and practitioners embark on a forward-looking exploration of creative conceptual frameworks, training methods, and case studies that advance relational, networking, and collaborative strategies in public diplomacy. Light on academic jargon and rich in analysis, this volume argues that while relationships have always been pivotal to the practice of public diplomacy, the relational dynamics are changing. Rather than focus on specific definitions, the contributors focus on the dynamic interplay of influence in the public diplomacy environment. That environment includes state and non-state actors, public and private partners, competitors and collaborators, new and old media, and is conditioned by power, ethics, and cultures. This book is an essential resource to students and practitioners interested on how to build relationships and transform them into more elaborate network structures through public communication. It will challenge you to push the boundaries of what you think are the mechanisms, benefits, and potential issues raised by a relational approach to public diplomacy","2014-02-05","http://books.google.es/books?id=_m_MAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA155&dq=risky+%2B+networked&hl=&cd=2&source=gbs_api","9781136179211",

Four key interlinking themes emerge from the chapters. The first is how, within a neoliberal context, risk agendas can be used to justify and normalise the rationing and targeting of services. The second theme shows how the use of such agendas can in themselves redefine what is constituted as social problems, and how they are understood and responded to. Thirdly, welfare practice itself is being re-structured and re-theorised to adapt and conform to the new definitions and understandings that risk thinking has brought about. Finally, the fourth theme is how the use of risk as a negative organising discourse is not inevitable but, in different contexts, can create positive outcomes for service users, practitioners and society.","2013-08-02","http://books.google.es/books?id=vfYzAAAAQBAJ&pg=PA143&dq=risky+%2B+networked&hl=&cd=7&source=gbs_api","9781137276087",

As the business paradigm shifts from voice-centric to data-centric mobile services, the ways of analyzing the industry need to evolve as well. Mobile Services in the Networked Economy provides new insight into the structure and dynamics of the mobile services industry by combining novel ideas from the complexity theory, from the research of vertical integration strategies and from the theories of networked organizations. These ideas and theories are then applied to the context of three different types of mobile services markets in Japan, Finland and the UK. The case analyses demonstrate how the three markets are currently going through very distinct phases of evolution in a continuum between two very different kinds of business environments. The analysis of the mobile services industry presented in this book will help the reader not only to understand the logic behind the way the industry looks today, but also to foresee possible future trends in the development of a given mobile services market.","2005-01-01","http://books.google.es/books?id=wrf8IeXXzwAC&pg=PA51&dq=risky+%2B+networked&hl=&cd=13&source=gbs_api","9781591405801",

"Networked Governance of Freedom and Tyranny. Peace in Timor-Leste","risky + networked","[John Braithwaite, Hilary C. Charlesworth, Adérito Soares]","[History]","This book offers a new approach to the extraordinary story of Timor-Leste. The Indonesian invasion of the former Portuguese colony in 1975 was widely considered to have permanently crushed the Timorese independence movement. Initial international condemnation of the invasion was quickly replaced by widespread acceptance of Indonesian sovereignty. But inside Timor-Leste various resistance networks maintained their struggle, against all odds. Twenty-four years later, the Timorese were allowed to choose their political future and the new country of Timor-Leste came into being in 2002. This book presents freedom in Timor-Leste as an accomplishment of networked governance, arguing that weak networks are capable of controlling strong tyrannies. Yet, as events in Timor-Leste since independence show, the nodes of networks of freedom can themselves become nodes of tyranny. The authors argue that constant renewal of liberation networks is critical for peace with justice - feminist networks for the liberation of women, preventive diplomacy networks for liberation of victims of war, village development networks, civil society networks. Constant renewal of the separation of powers is also necessary. A case is made for a different way of seeing the separation of powers as constitutive of the republican ideal of freedom as non-domination. The book is also a critique of realism as a theory of international affairs and of the limits of reforming tyranny through the centralised agency of a state sovereign. Reversal of Indonesia's 1975 invasion of Timor-Leste was an implausible accomplishment. Among the things that achieved it was principled engagement with Indonesia and its democracy movement by the Timor resistance. Unprincipled engagement by Australia and the United States in particular allowed the 1975 invasion to occur. The book argues that when the international community regulates tyranny responsively, with principled engagement, there is hope for a domestic politics of nonviolent transformation for freedom and justice.","2012","http://books.google.es/books?id=T-i6ZAcdeqAC&pg=PA67&dq=risky+%2B+networked&hl=&cd=16&source=gbs_api","9781921862762",

"Disasters and the Networked Economy","risky + networked","[J.M. Albala-Bertrand]","[Business & Economics]","Mainstream quantitative analysis and simulations are fraught with difficulties and are intrinsically unable to deal appropriately with long-term macroeconomic effects of disasters. In this new book, J.M. Albala-Bertrand develops the themes introduced in his past book, The Political Economy of Large Natural Disasters (Clarendon Press, 1993), to show that societal networking and disaster localization constitute part of an essential framework to understand disaster effects and responses. The author’s last book argued that disasters were a problem of development, rather than a problem for development. This volume takes the argument forward both in terms of the macroeconomic effects of disaster and development policy, arguing that economy and society are not inert objects, but living organisms. Using a framework based on societal networking and the economic localization of disasters, the author shows that societal functionality (defined as the capacity of a system to survive, reproduce and develop) is unlikely to be impaired by natural disasters. This book will be of interest to scholars and practitioners involved in disaster analysis and response policy, and will also be relevant to students of development economics.","2013-05-02","http://books.google.es/books?id=uHiwSQRUEVcC&pg=PA80&dq=risky+%2B+networked&hl=&cd=18&source=gbs_api","9781135953386",

Focusing on various forms of design, implementation and integration of computer mediated communication, this book bridges the academic fields of computer science and communication studies. Designing for Networked Communications: Strategies and Development uses an interdisciplinary approach, and presents results from recent and important research in a variety of forms for networked communications. A constructive and critical view of the interplay between the new electronic and the more conventional modes of communication are utilized, while studies of organizational work practices demonstrate that the use of new technologies and media is best understood and integrated into work practices. In this process of merging, both are remodelled and rearranged while being adapted to the practices and activities for which they were designed.","2007-01-01","http://books.google.es/books?id=YEpAYyIRlbEC&pg=PA244&dq=risky+%2B+networked&hl=&cd=23&source=gbs_api","9781599040714",

"Collaborative Networked Organizations. A Research Agenda for Emerging Business Models","risky + networked","[Luis M. Camarinha-Matos, Hamideh Afsarmanesh]","[Business & Economics]","The emerging paradigm of collaborative networked organizations (CNOs), or simply collaborative networks, represents a dynamic and multidisciplinary research and development area for which a number of research results are available from many international and national projects. A large number of practical application experiments and pilot cases also provide evidence on what works and what still remains as a challenge for CNOs. The fast evolution of information and communication technologies and in particular the so-called Internet technologies, also represents an important motivator for the emergence of new forms of collaboration. There is, however, an urgent need to start more consolidated and holistic research strategies to support proper developments in this area. This book includes a comprehensive set of recommendations from the multi-disciplines involved in CNOs, towards the establishment of a research agenda for emerging collaborative networks. These recommendations are the result of a 30-month initiative, the THINKcreative project, involving more than 250 experts and visionaries from academia, research, and industry. Collaborative Networked Organizations provides valuable elements for research strategy planners, decision-makers at research funding organizations, group leaders in research institutions, and heads of research departments in companies interested in research and innovative development activities in the area of e-business and collaborative networks. Furthermore, the book can also provide valuable direction to PhD advisors and PhD students to focus their research themes.","2004-03-31","http://books.google.es/books?id=s5GZinroNPEC&pg=PA116&dq=risky+%2B+networked&hl=&cd=25&source=gbs_api","1402078234",

"Networked Collaborative Learning. Social interaction and Active Learning","risky + networked","[Guglielmo Trentin]","[Education]","The sustainability of Networked Collaborative Learning (NCL) is a key topic of discussion amongst the institutions where it has been or may potentially be introduced. In order to determine the extent of NCL's sustainability, the added value university education may yield by adopting collaborative learning strategies must be quantified. In turn, an understanding of the implications NCL produces in terms of design and management is gained. After comparing NCL with other Technology Enhanced Learning (TEL) approaches and discussing the possible reasons for adopting it, a multidimensional model for the sustainability of NCL is proposed. The model is characterized by four dimensions: pedagogical approaches, e-teacher professional development, instructional design models and valuation/assessment approaches. Each of these dimensions is examined on the basis of the author’s direct experience gained through applying NCL to his university teaching.

"Networked Machinists. High-Technology Industries in Antebellum America","risky + networked","[David R. Meyer]","[Business & Economics]","A century and a half before the modern information technology revolution, machinists in the eastern United States created the nation's first high technology industries. In iron foundries and steam-engine works, locomotive works, machine and tool shops, textile-machinery firms, and firearms manufacturers, these resourceful workers pioneered the practice of dispersing technological expertise through communities of practice. In the first book to study this phenomenon since the 1916 classic, English and American Tool Builders, David R. Meyer examines the development of skilled-labor exchange systems, showing how individual metalworking sectors grew and moved outward. He argues that the networked behavior of machinists within and across industries helps explain the rapid transformation of metalworking industries during the antebellum period, building a foundation for the sophisticated, mass production/consumer industries that figured so prominently in the later U.S. economy.","2006-11-17","http://books.google.es/books?id=3rev1Icp6iwC&pg=PA147&dq=risky+%2B+networked&hl=&cd=28&source=gbs_api","0801884713",

"Consent of the Networked. The Worldwide Struggle for Internet Freedom","risky + networked","[Rebecca MacKinnon]","[Computers]","The Internet was going to liberate us, but in truth it has not. For every story about the web’s empowering role in events such as the Arab Spring, there are many more about the quiet corrosion of civil liberties by companies and governments using the same digital technologies we have come to depend upon. Sudden changes in Facebook’s features and privacy settings have exposed identities of protestors to police in Egypt and Iran. Apple removes politically controversial apps at the behest of governments as well as for its own commercial reasons. Dozens of Western companies sell surveillance technology to dictatorships around the world. Google struggles with censorship demands from governments in a range of countries—many of them democracies—as well as mounting public concern over the vast quantities of information it collects about its users. In Consent of the Networked,journalist and Internet policy specialist Rebecca MacKinnon argues that it is time to fight for our rights before they are sold, legislated, programmed, and engineered away. Every day, the corporate sovereigns of cyberspace make decisions that affect our physical freedom—but without our consent. Yet the traditional solution to unaccountable corporate behavior—government regulation—cannot stop the abuse of digital power on its own, and sometimes even contributes to it.

"New Models for Ecosystem Dynamics and Restoration","risky + ecosystem","[Richard J. Hobbs, Katharine N. Suding, Peter Society for Ecological Restoration International]","[Science]","As scientific understanding about ecological processes has grown, the idea that ecosystem dynamics are complex, nonlinear, and often unpredictable has gained prominence. Of particular importance is the idea that rather than following an inevitable progression toward an ultimate endpoint, some ecosystems may occur in a number of states depending on past and present ecological conditions. The emerging idea of “restoration thresholds” also enables scientists to recognize when ecological systems are likely to recover on their own and when active restoration efforts are needed. Conceptual models based on alternative stable states and restoration thresholds can help inform restoration efforts. New Models for Ecosystem Dynamics and Restoration brings together leading experts from around the world to explore how conceptual models of ecosystem dynamics can be applied to the recovery of degraded systems and how recent advances in our understanding of ecosystem and landscape dynamics can be translated into conceptual and practical frameworks for restoration. In the first part of the book, background chapters present and discuss the basic concepts and models and explore the implications of new scientific research on restoration practice. The second part considers the dynamics and restoration of different ecosystems, ranging from arid lands to grasslands, woodlands, and savannahs, to forests and wetlands, to production landscapes. A summary chapter by the editors discusses the implications of theory and practice of the ideas described in preceding chapters. New Models for Ecosystem Dynamics and Restoration aims to widen the scope and increase the application of threshold models by critiquing their application in a wide range of ecosystem types. It will also help scientists and restorationists correctly diagnose ecosystem damage, identify restoration thresholds, and develop corrective methodologies that can overcome such thresholds.","2009-01-07","http://books.google.es/books?id=TxwKQG_7HlgC&pg=PA106&dq=risky+%2B+ecosystem&hl=&cd=3&source=gbs_api","1610911385",

"Managed Annihilation. An Unnatural History of the Newfoundland Cod Collapse","risky + ecosystem","[Dean Bavington]",,"The commercial cod fishery in Newfoundland and Labrador was once the most successful fishery in the world. When it collapsed in 1992 - causing the largest single-day layoff in Canadian history and irrevocable ecological damage - fishermen, scholars, and scientists pointed to failures in management such as uncontrolled harvesting as likely culprits. Examining the history of commercial cod fisheries in the region from the mid-nineteenth century, Managed Annihilation makes the case that the very idea of natural resource management caused the death of the cod. The collapse occurred when the fisheries were ostensibly managed by the state, and the fishery has still not recovered nearly two decades later. Although the collapse raised doubts among policy-makers about their ability to understand, predict, and control nature, their ultimate goal of control through management has not wavered - it has simply been transferred onto new targets.","2011-01-01","http://books.google.es/books?id=7Go8OKkRVgUC&pg=PA85&dq=risky+%2B+ecosystem&hl=&cd=8&source=gbs_api","9780774859509",

"Resolving Ecosystem Complexity (MPB-47)","risky + ecosystem","[Oswald J. Schmitz]","[Nature]","An ecosystem's complexity develops from the vast numbers of species interacting in ecological communities. The nature of these interactions, in turn, depends on environmental context. How do these components together influence an ecosystem's behavior as a whole? Can ecologists resolve an ecosystem's complexity in order to predict its response to disturbances? Resolving Ecosystem Complexity develops a framework for anticipating the ways environmental context determines the functioning of ecosystems. Oswald Schmitz addresses the critical questions of contemporary ecology: How should an ecosystem be conceptualized to blend its biotic and biophysical components? How should evolutionary ecological principles be used to derive an operational understanding of complex, adaptive ecosystems? How should the relationship between the functional biotic diversity of ecosystems and their properties be understood? Schmitz begins with the universal concept that ecosystems are comprised of species that consume resources and which are then resources for other consumers. From this, he deduces a fundamental rule or evolutionary ecological mechanism for explaining context dependency: individuals within a species trade off foraging gains against the risk of being consumed by predators. Through empirical examples, Schmitz illustrates how species use evolutionary ecological strategies to negotiate a predator-eat-predator world, and he suggests that the implications of species trade-offs are critical to making ecology a predictive science. Bridging the traditional divides between individuals, populations, and communities in ecology, Resolving Ecosystem Complexity builds a systematic foundation for thinking about natural systems.","2010-07-01","http://books.google.es/books?id=yvoNH2O03b0C&pg=PA7&dq=risky+%2B+ecosystem&hl=&cd=13&source=gbs_api","9781400834174",

Public awareness of our species' self-destructiveness as material beings in a material world is growing - but so is the destructiveness. The practical interventions needed for saving and restoring the earth will require a collective shift of such magnitude as to take on a spiritual and religious intensity. This transformation has in part already begun. Traditions of ecological theology and ecologically awarereligious practice have been preparing the way for decades. Yet these traditions still remain marginal to society, academy, and church. With a fresh, transdisciplinary approach, Ecospirit probes the possibility of a green shift radical enough to permeate the ancient roots of our sensibility and the social sources of our practice. From new language for imagining the earth as a living ground to current constructions of nature in theology, science, and philosophy; from environmentalism's questioning of postmodern thought to a garden of green doctrines, rituals, and liturgies for contemporary religion, these original essays explore and expand our sense of how to proceed in the face of an ecological crisis that demands new thinking and acting.

In making decisions about human activities, such as draining a wetland for a housing development, it is essential to consider both the value of the development and the value of the ecosystem services that could be lost. Despite a growing recognition of the importance of ecosystem services, their value is often overlooked in environmental decision-making. This report identifies methods for assigning economic value to ecosystem services?even intangible ones?and calls for greater collaboration between ecologists and economists in such efforts.","2005-04-28","http://books.google.es/books?id=HgkMhzsXfBMC&pg=PA192&dq=risky+%2B+ecosystem&hl=&cd=24&source=gbs_api","0309133459",

It is home not only to the last great megafaunal assemblage, but also to human populations with the highest growth rates. This book draws on the expertise of leading ecologists, each intimately familiar with a particular set of East African ecosystems, to provide the first in-depth and integrated account of the ecology, management, threats, and conservation of these diverse ecosystems. Summarizing the tremendous wealth of scientific research that has come out of East Africa in the last few decades, each chapter analyzes a given ecosystem type, taking the reader through the basics of its ecology, its historical use (and misuse) by humans, and its prospects for conservation. Throughout the book, linkages and similarities among ecosystems are emphasized, the historical and contemporary role of humans in shaping these ecosystems is considered, fundamental principles of ecology are considered, and interesting case studies are highlighted.

"How Much is an Ecosystem Worth?. Assessing the Economic Value of Conservation","risky + ecosystem",,"[Business]","""The international community has committed itself to achieve, by 2010, a significant reduction of the current rate of biodiversity loss at the global, regional, and national levels. Yet, despite growing awareness, and major efforts in all countries, the latest evidence indicates that biodiversity continues to be lost at a terrifying pace, resulting in what some call the greatest mass extinction since dinosaurs roamed the planet, 65 million years ago. A range of methods have been developed to value ecosystems, and the services they provide, as well as the costs of conservation. The methods available are increasingly sensitive, and robust, but they are often incorrectly used. One reason is poor understanding of the purposes of valuation and what questions it can, or cannot, answer. As a result, decision makers may get misleading guidance on the value of ecosystems, and their conservation. In this context, the Bank, IUCN-The World Conservation Union, and the Nature Conservancy have worked together to clarify the aims and uses of economic valuation, focusing on the types of questions that valuation can answer, and the type of valuation that is best suited to each purpose. How Much is an Ecosystem Worth? is the result of that cooperation. It aims to provide guidance on how economic valuation can be used to address specific, policy-relevant questions about nature conservation.""","2005-01-01","http://books.google.es/books?id=FI-mdPzaQv8C&pg=PA3&dq=risky+%2B+ecosystem&hl=&cd=33&source=gbs_api","9780821363799",
"The Law and Policy of Ecosystem Services","risky + ecosystem","[J.B. Ruhl, Steven E. Kraft, Christopher L. Lant]","[Law]","The Law and Policy of Ecosystem Services is the first comprehensive exploration of the status and future of natural capital and ecosystem services in American law and policy. The book develops a framework for thinking about ecosystem services across their ecologic, geographic, economic, social, and legal dimensions and evaluates the prospects of crafting a legal infrastructure that can help build an ecosystem service economy that is as robust as existing economies for manufactured goods, natural resource commodities, and human-provided services. The book examines the geographic, ecological, and economic context of ecosystem services and provides a baseline of the current status of ecosystem services in law and society. It identifies shortcomings of current law and policy and the critical areas for improvement and forges an approach for the design of new law and policy for ecosystem services. Included are a series of nine empirical case studies that explore the problems caused by society’s failure to properly value natural capital. Among the case study topics considered are water issues, The Conservation Reserve Program, the National Conservation Buffer Initiative, the agricultural policy of the European Union, wetland mitigation, and pollution trading. The Law and Policy of Ecosystem Services is a groundbreaking look at the question of whether and how law and policy can shape a sustainable system of ecosystem service management. It is an accessible and informative work for faculty, students, and policy makers concerned with ecology, economics, geography, political science, environmental studies, law, and related fields.","2007-05-21","http://books.google.es/books?id=VEF48vqc0zcC&pg=PA247&dq=risky+%2B+ecosystem&hl=&cd=34&source=gbs_api","1597267694",
"The Economics of Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services","risky + ecosystem","[Shunsuke Managi]","[Business & Economics]","Ecosystems and biodiversity have been degraded over decades due to human activities. One of the critical causes is market failure: the current market only accounts tangible resources and neglects intangible functions, such as climate control and natural hazard mitigation. Under such circumstances in capitalism, land conversion and resource exploitation, which generate financial income, are highly prioritised over conservation, which is not necessarily beneficial in monetary terms. To halt ecosystem degradation, thus, the values of ecosystem services need to be visualised and economic instruments for ecosystem conservation should be further developed. This book focuses on these two aspects and performs several studies, including valuation of ecosystem services, productivity analysis, institutional design of payment for ecosystem services (PES), impact assessment of reduction emission from deforestation and forest degradation (REDD), and economic experiment of mitigation banking scheme. From these analysis, economic values of ecosystem services are demonstrated from both supply and demand side, and the directions for improving economic instruments are indicated both directly and indirectly. As many of these analysis are usually conducted in the North America and Europe, this book is unique in geographical focus, namely, Japan, Asia and globe. Also, wide variety of ecosystems are targeted for studies; agricultural lands, forests, wetlands, and marine. Hence, this will be informative introduction for those who desire to study economics of biodiversity and ecosystem services in these regions and of these ecological zones.","2012","http://books.google.es/books?id=UbLiEOeK2TMC&pg=PA237&dq=risky+%2B+ecosystem&hl=&cd=37&source=gbs_api","9780415625630",

"Discontinuities in Ecosystems and Other Complex Systems","risky + ecosystems","[Craig R. Allen, C. S. Holling]","[Business & Economics]","Following the publication of C. S. Holling's seminal work on the relationship between animal body mass patterns and scale-specific landscape structure, ecologists began to explore the theoretical and applied consequences of discontinuities in ecosystems and other complex systems. Are ecosystems and their components continuously distributed and do they adhere to scaling laws, or are they discontinuous and more complex than early models would have us believe? The resulting propositions over the structure of complex systems sparked an ongoing debate regarding the mechanisms generating discontinuities and the statistical methods used for their detection. This volume takes the view that ecosystems and other complex systems are inherently discontinuous and that such fields as ecology, economics, and urban studies greatly benefit from this paradigm shift. Contributors present evidence of the ubiquity of discontinuous distributions in ecological and social systems and how their analysis provides insight into complex phenomena. The book is divided into three sections. The first focuses on background material and contrasting views concerning the discontinuous organization of complex systems. The second discusses discontinuous patterns detected in a number of different systems and methods for detecting them, and the third touches on the potential significance of discontinuities in complex systems. Science is still dominated by a focus on power laws, but the contributors to this volume are convinced power laws often mask the interesting dynamics of systems and that those dynamics are best revealed by investigating deviations from assumed power law distributions. In 2008, a grand conference on resilience was held in Stockholm, hosting 600 participants from around the world. There are now three big centers established with resilience, the most recent one being the Stockholm Resilience Center, with others in Australia (an international coral reef center), Arizona State University's new sustainability center focusing on anthropology, and Canada's emerging social sciences and resilience center. Activity continues to flourish in Alaska, South Africa, and the Untied Kingdom, and a new center is forming in Uruguay.","2013-08-13","http://books.google.es/books?id=tJaOiGlcLeIC&pg=PT314&dq=risky+%2B+ecosystems&hl=&cd=5&source=gbs_api","9780231516822",

"Applications of Seasonal Climate Forecasting in Agricultural and Natural Ecosystems. The Australian Experience","risky + ecosystems","[Graeme L. Hammer, Neville Nicholls, Christopher Mitchell]","[Nature]","Climate variability has major impacts in many parts of the world, including Australia. Developments in understanding of the El Niño - Southern Oscillation Phenomenon have introduced some skill in seasonal to inter-annual climate forecasting. Can this skill be harnessed to advantage? Or do we just continue to observe these impacts? How does a decision-maker managing an agricultural or natural ecosystem modify decisions in response to a skillful, but imprecise, seasonal climate forecast? Using Australian experience as a basis, this book focuses on these questions in pursuing means to better manage climate risks. The state of the science in climate forecasting is reviewed before considering detailed examples of applications to: farm scale agricultural decisions (such as management of cropping and grazing systems); regional and national scale agricultural decisions (such as commodity trading and government policy); and natural systems (such as water resources, pests and diseases, and natural fauna). Many of the examples highlight the participatory and inter-disciplinary approach required among decision-makers, resource systems scientists/analysts, and climate scientists to bring about the effective applications. The experiences discussed provide valuable insights beyond the geographical and disciplinary focus of this book. The book is ideally suited to professionals and postgraduate students in ecology, agricultural climatology, environmental planning, and climate science.","2000-09-30","http://books.google.es/books?id=9S63eJ-0f8UC&pg=PA177&dq=risky+%2B+ecosystems&hl=&cd=9&source=gbs_api","0792362705",

"Novel Ecosystems. Intervening in the New Ecological World Order","risky + ecosystems","[Richard J. Hobbs, Eric S. Higgs, Carol Hall]","[Nature]","Land conversion, climate change and species invasions are contributing to the widespread emergence of novel ecosystems, which demand a shift in how we think about traditional approaches to conservation, restoration and environmental management. They are novel because they exist without historical precedents and are self-sustaining. Traditional approaches emphasizing native species and historical continuity are challenged by novel ecosystems that deliver critical ecosystems services or are simply immune to practical restorative efforts. Some fear that, by raising the issue of novel ecosystems, we are simply paving the way for a more laissez-faire attitude to conservation and restoration. Regardless of the range of views and perceptions about novel ecosystems, their existence is becoming ever more obvious and prevalent in today’s rapidly changing world. In this first comprehensive volume to look at the ecological, social, cultural, ethical and policy dimensions of novel ecosystems, the authors argue these altered systems are overdue for careful analysis and that we need to figure out how to intervene in them responsibly. This book brings together researchers from a range of disciplines together with practitioners and policy makers to explore the questions surrounding novel ecosystems. It includes chapters on key concepts and methodologies for deciding when and how to intervene in systems, as well as a rich collection of case studies and perspective pieces. It will be a valuable resource for researchers, managers and policy makers interested in the question of how humanity manages and restores ecosystems in a rapidly changing world.

Many of the plantations that are being grown around the globe are non-native species that have characteristics of rapid growth and good commercial qualities. In some cases, the high rates of production are a result of the absence of native herbivore and diseases. This limited pest status is threatened as pest species move around the globe. At the same time there is concern about threats of these non-native plantation species on native communities and the impact of changing climates on forest productivity.

"Measuring Systemic Risk-Adjusted Liquidity (SRL) - A Model Approach","riskiness + systemic","[Andreas Jobst]","[Business & Economics]","Little progress has been made so far in addressing—in a comprehensive way—the externalities caused by impact of the interconnectedness within institutions and markets on funding and market liquidity risk within financial systems. The Systemic Risk-adjusted Liquidity (SRL) model combines option pricing with market information and balance sheet data to generate a probabilistic measure of the frequency and severity of multiple entities experiencing a joint liquidity event. It links a firm’s maturity mismatch between assets and liabilities impacting the stability of its funding with those characteristics of other firms, subject to individual changes in risk profiles and common changes in market conditions. This approach can then be used (i) to quantify an individual institution’s time-varying contribution to system-wide liquidity shortfalls and (ii) to price liquidity risk within a macroprudential framework that, if used to motivate a capital charge or insurance premia, provides incentives for liquidity managers to internalize the systemic risk of their decisions. The model can also accommodate a stress testing approach for institution-specific and/or general funding shocks that generate estimates of systemic liquidity risk (and associated charges) under adverse scenarios.","2012-08-01","http://books.google.es/books?id=21oOVVMTypgC&pg=PA19&dq=riskiness+%2B+systemic&hl=&cd=3&source=gbs_api","9781475576634",
"Systemic Liquidity Risk and Bipolar Markets. Wealth Management in Today's Macro Risk On / Risk Off Financial Environment","riskiness + systemic","[Clive M. Corcoran]","[Business & Economics]","The dramatic and well chronicled crisis of 2007/8 marked a watershed moment for all stakeholders in global capital markets. In the aftermath, financial markets have become even more tightly coupled as correlations in returns across multiple asset classes have been at historically elevated levels. Investors and fund managers are, to a much larger degree than previously and often much more than they realize, subject to the risk of severe wealth destruction. The ultimate hazard, which is not adequately characterized by the widely touted notion of tail risk, is the systemic risk which arises when liquidity in markets completely evaporates. Not only did this happen in the second half of 2008, but it has been repeated episodically since then – most notably in May 2010, in an incident known as the Flash Crash, and in the fall of 2011 when correlations were at historically elevated levels. Conventional asset allocation tools and techniques have failed to keep apace with the changing financial landscape which has emerged since 2008. In addition to the preponderance of algorithmic trading and the associated changes in the liquidity characteristics of financial markets, a new paradigm of risk on/risk off asset allocation has emerged. Risk on/risk off is a widely adopted style of trading and macro allocation strategy where positions are taken in several closely aligned asset classes depending on the prevailing sentiment or appetite for risk. The consequences of the day to day (and intraday) switching between either a risk on or risk off tactical strategies poses significant new challenges to investors who are still making investment decisions with outmoded notions from traditional asset allocation theory. How can one cushion the impact of systemically threatening events when the ability to exit financial instruments becomes almost non existent? How can one trust the integrity of financial models and orthodox macro financial theory which have become increasingly discredited? Can central bankers be relied upon to become the counter-parties of last resort and provide a safety net under the financial system? These vital questions, and many others, need to be addressed by everyone who has a stake in modern financial markets, and they are addressed in Systemic Liquidity Risk and Bipolar Markets. Proper functioning markets require fractiousness or divided opinion, and this needs to be lubricated by communications from central bankers, economic forecasters, corporate executives and so on. As long as such messages and market conditions remain ambiguous, providing asymmetric information to different market players, then the conditions are present to enable systemic liquidity to be preserved. Seen in this context the prevailing paradigm of bipolar risk on/risk off asset allocations is both a prerequisite to liquid markets, and also paradoxically, when one side of the polarity becomes too extreme, a major source of systemic instability. Should such polarities become critically unbalanced, and should the signals received by market players become symmetrically disadvantageous as they were in the fall of 2008, then an even more substantial systemic liquidity crisis than that seen in those troubled times is a dangerous possibility. Apart from the practical risk management tools and tactics that are recommended in Systemic Liquidity Risk and Bipolar Markets, there is a provocative and cogent narrative to provide anxious and perplexed investors with a coherent explanation of the post GFC financial environment, and which should assist them in navigating the choppy waters ahead.","2012-11-26","http://books.google.es/books?id=mKMd-z8R11sC&pg=PT297&dq=riskiness+%2B+systemic&hl=&cd=14&source=gbs_api","9781118410806",
"Systemic Risk from Global Financial Derivatives: A Network Analysis of Contagion and Its Mitigation with Super-Spreader Tax","riskiness + systemic","[Ms. Sheri M. Markose]","[Business & Economics]","Financial network analysis is used to provide firm level bottom-up holistic visualizations of interconnections of financial obligations in global OTC derivatives markets. This helps to identify Systemically Important Financial Intermediaries (SIFIs), analyse the nature of contagion propagation, and also monitor and design ways of increasing robustness in the network. Based on 2009 FDIC and individually collected firm level data covering gross notional, gross positive (negative) fair value and the netted derivatives assets and liabilities for 202 financial firms which includes 20 SIFIs, the bilateral flows are empirically calibrated to reflect data-based constraints. This produces a tiered network with a distinct highly clustered central core of 12 SIFIs that account for 78 percent of all bilateral exposures and a large number of financial intermediaries (FIs) on the periphery. The topology of the network results in the “Too- Interconnected-To-Fail” (TITF) phenomenon in that the failure of any member of the central tier will bring down other members with the contagion coming to an abrupt end when the ‘super-spreaders’ have demised. As these SIFIs account for the bulk of capital in the system, ipso facto no bank among the top tier can be allowed to fail, highlighting the untenable implicit socialized guarantees needed for these markets to operate at their current levels. Systemic risk costs of highly connected SIFIs nodes are not priced into their holding of capital or collateral. An eigenvector centrality based ‘super-spreader’ tax has been designed and tested for its capacity to reduce the potential socialized losses from failure of SIFIs.","2012-11-30","http://books.google.es/books?id=u9SqWVbez-AC&pg=PT14&dq=riskiness+%2B+systemic&hl=&cd=18&source=gbs_api","9781475531862",

"Corporate Governance Failures. The Role of Institutional Investors in the Global Financial Crisis","riskiness + systemic","[James P. Hawley, Shyam J. Kamath, Andrew T. Williams]","[Business & Economics]","Corporate governance, the internal policies and leadership that guide the actions of corporations, played a major part in the recent global financial crisis. While much blame has been targeted at compensation arrangements that rewarded extreme risk-taking but did not punish failure, the performance of large, supposedly sophisticated institutional investors in this crisis has gone for the most part unexamined. Shareholding organizations, such as pension funds and mutual funds, hold considerable sway over the financial industry from Wall Street to the City of London. Corporate Governance Failures: The Role of Institutional Investors in the Global Financial Crisis exposes the misdeeds and lapses of these institutional investors leading up to the recent economic meltdown. In this collection of original essays, edited by pioneers in the field of fiduciary capitalism, top legal and financial practitioners and researchers discuss detrimental actions and inaction of institutional investors. Corporate Governance Failures reveals how these organizations exposed themselves and their clientele to extremely complex financial instruments, such as credit default swaps, through investments in hedge and private equity funds as well as more traditional equity investments in large financial institutions. The book's contributors critique fund executives for tolerating the ""pursuit of alpha"" culture that led managers to pursue risky financial strategies in hopes of outperforming the market. The volume also points out how and why institutional investors failed to effectively monitor such volatile investments, ignoring relatively well-established corporate governance principles and best practices. Along with detailed investigations of institutional investor missteps, Corporate Governance Failures offers nuanced and realistic proposals to mitigate future financial pitfalls. This volume provides fresh perspectives on ways institutional investors can best act as gatekeepers and promote responsible investment.","2011-04-15","http://books.google.es/books?id=iiAulO5LLxAC&pg=PA98&dq=riskiness+%2B+systemic&hl=&cd=24&source=gbs_api","9780812204643",

"The Future of Futures. The Time of Money in Financing and Society","riskiness + systemic","[Elena Esposito]","[Business & Economics]","'Within the cacophony of voices trying to explain the recent financial crisis, Elena Esposito's voice sounds clear and deep. Steering away from simplistic condemnations and equally simplistic prescriptions for betterment, she connects the very invention of derivatives to that eternal human hope – of controlling the future. While the task is impossible, the attempts never stop, and the very process of attempting it brings some consolation. And while derivatives can be seen, claim sociologists of finance, as performative, that is shaping the future they promise to control, even this is far from certain. Esposito's fascinating and beautiful work is an important contribution to the sociology of finance, a subdiscipline of sociology that took on itself an extremely important task of explaining how the finance markets really work.'– Barbara Czarniawska, University of Gothenburg, Sweden'This is a brilliant and timely book that shows how financing is centrally implicated in the very unpredictability and uncertainty it purports to master. With the incisiveness characteristic of her style and writing, Esposito reads economics in innovative ways that disclose the hidden premises by which financial instruments trade and consume the prospects of the future.' – Jannis Kallinikos, London School of Economics, UK'Elena Esposito's analysis of financial markets and of their recent decline is radically different from the analyses which can be found in economic journals or books. Financial operations are reduced to their basic dimensions: time and money. Under this perspective, what is sold on financial markets is the possibility for the creation of commitments in the course of time, the possibility for the combination of these commitments with one another, and the identification of chances for the achievement of profit opportunities through the creation of specific combinations. The author argues that the recent crisis of the financial system was caused by oversimplified visions of the future and of risk leading to the consequence that options were not available in the present because all possibilities had been used up by the future. This oversimplified vision of the future imploded, and trust with it. The state tried to reconstruct options for the future in order to open up new possibilities and chances for learning. The author does not deliver recipes on how to prevent severe crises of the financial system in the future. Yet, her concept facilitates understanding of how financial futures are opened up or closed and thus provides insights into basic principles on whose basis future opportunities can be kept open and trust can be maintained. Innovative reforms of the financial system can only develop on the basis of unconventional analyses. Elena Esposito's book contains an analysis of this kind.'– Alfred Kieser, Mannheim University, Germany'Elena Esposito's book is a fundamental analysis of time in economics. With economic rigour underpinned by sociological reasoning, she explains the futures market more clearly than is possible with economic analysis alone. Economic concepts are considered in terms of time – actors deal in the present with future risks by transferring these risks to the present situation. As a result, we get more options and more risks at the same time: at present. No equilibrium will balance these trades because of the asymmetry of time: our actual decisions deal with our imagination of the future, that is, with the future of the present, but the results will be realized in the presence of the future – different modalities of time. The book is a sound reflection on modelling time in economic theory, a ""must"" for economists.'– Birger P. Priddat, Witten/Herdecke University, Germany'The Future of Futures is an original and intellectually provocative book which forces the reader to think. Esposito's essay fulfils two rather different functions. On the one hand, it brings new and persuasive arguments to bear against the erroneous thesis that the present financial crisis is merely due to human mistakes and to some specific government failures. On the other hand, the book suggests that only by reconsidering the role of time in the economy is it possible to make full sense of the crisis and to re-orient in a desired direction the future movements of money. It is a well-known fact that traditional economics has always adhered to a spatial conception of time, according to which time, like space, is perfectly reversible. Whence its inability both to understand how economies develop and to prescribe adequate policies. The author's proposal is to move steps ahead in the direction of an analysis of an economy in time, where both historical time and time as duration can find a place. Esposito's well-written, jargon-free book will capture the attention of anyone seriously interested in the future of our market systems.'– Stefano Zamagni, University of Bologna and Johns Hopkins University, Bologna Center, Italy This book reconstructs the dynamics of economics, beginning explicitly with the role and the relevance of time: money uses the future in order to generate present wealth. Financial markets sell and buy risk, thereby binding the future. Elena Esposito explains that complex risk management techniques of structured finance produce new and uncontrolled risks because they use a simplified idea of the future, failing to account for how the future reacts to attempts at controlling it. During the recent financial crisis, the future had already been used (through securitizations, derivatives and other tools) to the extent that we had many futures, but no open future available.","2011-01-01","http://books.google.es/books?id=dqVxR1ZrDwcC&pg=PA83&dq=riskiness+%2B+systemic&hl=&cd=33&source=gbs_api","9781849809115",

"Capital Structure Decisions. Evaluating Risk and Uncertainty","riskiness + structure","[Yamini Agarwal]","[Business & Economics]","Inside the risk management and corporate governance issues behind capital structure decisions Practical ways of determining capital structures have always been mysterious and riddled with risks and uncertainties. Dynamic paradigm shifts and the multi-dimensional operations of firms further complicate the situation. Financial leaders are under constant pressure to outdo their competitors, but how to do so is not always clear. Capital Structure Decisions offers an introduction to corporate finance, and provides valuable insights into the decision-making processes that face the CEOs and CFOs of organizations in dynamic multi-objective environments. Exploring the various models and techniques used to understand the capital structure of an organization, as well as the products and means available for financing these structures, the book covers how to develop a goal programming model to enable organization leaders to make better capital structure decisions. Incorporating international case studies to explain various financial models and to illustrate ways that capital structure choices determine their success, Capital Structure Decisions looks at existing models and the development of a new goal-programming model for capital structures that is capable of handling multiple objectives, with an emphasis throughout on mitigating risk. Helps financial leaders understand corporate finance and the decision-making processes involved in understanding and developing capital structure Includes case studies from around the world that explain key financial models Emphasizes ways to minimize risk when it comes to working with capital structures There are a number of criteria that financial leaders need to consider before making any major capital investment decision. Capital Structure Decisions analyzes the various risk management and corporate governance issues to be considered by any diligent CEO/CFO before approving a project.","2013-03-29","http://books.google.es/books?id=GZrtBtiCbcsC&pg=PP53&dq=riskiness+%2B+structure&hl=&cd=4&source=gbs_api","9781118203163",
"Risk Analysis for Islamic Banks","riskiness + structure","[Hennie van Greuning, Zamir Iqbal]","[Business & Economics]","Islamic finance is emerging as a rapidly growing part of the financial sector in the Islamic world and is not restricted to Islamic countries, but is spreading wherever there is a sizable Muslim community. According to some estimates, more than 250 financial institutions in over 45 countries practice some form of Islamic finance, and the industry has been growing at a rate of more than 15 percent annually for the past several years. The market's current annual turnover is estimated to be $70 billion, compared with a mere $5 billion in 1985, and is projected to hit the $100 billion mark by the turn of the century. Since the emergence of Islamic banks in the early 1970s, considerable research has been conducted, mainly focusing on the viability, design and operations of a deposit-accepting financial institution, which operates primarily on the basis of profit and loss partnerships rather than interest. This publication provides a comprehensive overview of topics related to the assessment, analysis, and management of various types of risks in the field of Islamic banking. It is an attempt to provide a high-level framework (aimed at non-specialist executives) attuned to the current realities of changing economies and Islamic financial markets. This approach emphasizes the accountability of key players in the corporate governance process in relation to the management of different dimensions of Islamic financial risk.","2008","http://books.google.es/books?id=Ejl-sEs4yPMC&pg=PA150&dq=riskiness+%2B+structure&hl=&cd=5&source=gbs_api","9780821371428",
"Hedge Fund Structure, Regulation, and Performance around the World","riskiness + structure","[Douglas Cumming, Na Dai, Sofia A. Johan]","[Law]","Hedge funds and their managers have been vilified in recent times for their high-risk activities and relative lack of regulatory oversight. A recurrent concern shared by market participants and regulators around the world is that the increasing size of the hedge fund industry coupled with potential agency problems, activist investment practices, and herding behavior may exacerbate financial instability. However, while it is frequently suggested that hedge funds are unregulated, they are in fact regulated to some degree in every country around the world. It is important to consider differences in legal and institutional settings across countries as they directly affect the structure, governance, and performance of hedge funds. In this book, the authors consider data from a multitude of countries to understand how and why hedge fund markets differ around the world. While hedge funds are hardly regulated in the US, other jurisdictions implement different and sometimes more onerous sets of regulatory requirements, which cann include, but are not limited to, minimum capitalization requirements, restrictions on the location of key service providers, and different permissible distribution channels via private placements, banks, other regulated or non-regulated financial intermediaries, wrappers, investment managers, and fund distribution companies.","2013-01-25","http://books.google.es/books?id=A2RfWPpoSloC&pg=PP38&dq=riskiness+%2B+structure&hl=&cd=6&source=gbs_api","9780199339846",

"Capital Structure and International Debt Shifting (EPub)","riskiness + structure","[Mr. Luc Laeven, Harry Huizinga, Gaetan Nicodeme]","[Business & Economics]","This paper presents a model of a multinational firm's optimal debt policy that incorporates international taxation factors. The model yields the prediction that a multinational firm's indebtedness in a country depends on a weighted average of national tax rates and differences between national and foreign tax rates. These differences matter because multinationals have an incentive to shift debt to high-tax countries. The predictions of the model are tested using a novel firm-level dataset for European multinationals and their subsidiaries, combined with newly collected data on the international tax treatment of dividend and interest streams. Our empirical results show that corporate debt policy indeed not only reflects domestic corporate tax rates but also differences in international tax systems. These findings contribute to our understanding of how corporate debt policy is set in an international context.","2007-02-01","http://books.google.es/books?id=6KTVa1gu6FwC&pg=PT44&dq=riskiness+%2B+structure&hl=&cd=11&source=gbs_api","9781451985306",

"The Theory of Corporate Finance","riskiness + structure","[Jean Tirole]","[Business & Economics]","The past twenty years have seen great theoretical and empirical advances in the field of corporate finance. Whereas once the subject addressed mainly the financing of corporations--equity, debt, and valuation--today it also embraces crucial issues of governance, liquidity, risk management, relationships between banks and corporations, and the macroeconomic impact of corporations. However, this progress has left in its wake a jumbled array of concepts and models that students are often hard put to make sense of. Here, one of the world's leading economists offers a lucid, unified, and comprehensive introduction to modern corporate finance theory. Jean Tirole builds his landmark book around a single model, using an incentive or contract theory approach. Filling a major gap in the field, The Theory of Corporate Finance is an indispensable resource for graduate and advanced undergraduate students as well as researchers of corporate finance, industrial organization, political economy, development, and macroeconomics. Tirole conveys the organizing principles that structure the analysis of today's key management and public policy issues, such as the reform of corporate governance and auditing; the role of private equity, financial markets, and takeovers; the efficient determination of leverage, dividends, liquidity, and risk management; and the design of managerial incentive packages. He weaves empirical studies into the book's theoretical analysis. And he places the corporation in its broader environment, both microeconomic and macroeconomic, and examines the two-way interaction between the corporate environment and institutions. Setting a new milestone in the field, The Theory of Corporate Finance will be the authoritative text for years to come.","2010-08-26","http://books.google.es/books?id=p683L1gaVm4C&pg=PA77&dq=riskiness+%2B+structure&hl=&cd=14&source=gbs_api","9781400830220",

"Rating Based Modeling of Credit Risk. Theory and Application of Migration Matrices","riskiness + structure","[Stefan Trueck, Svetlozar T. Rachev]","[Business & Economics]","In the last decade rating-based models have become very popular in credit risk management. These systems use the rating of a company as the decisive variable to evaluate the default risk of a bond or loan. The popularity is due to the straightforwardness of the approach, and to the upcoming new capital accord (Basel II), which allows banks to base their capital requirements on internal as well as external rating systems. Because of this, sophisticated credit risk models are being developed or demanded by banks to assess the risk of their credit portfolio better by recognizing the different underlying sources of risk. As a consequence, not only default probabilities for certain rating categories but also the probabilities of moving from one rating state to another are important issues in such models for risk management and pricing. It is widely accepted that rating migrations and default probabilities show significant variations through time due to macroeconomics conditions or the business cycle. These changes in migration behavior may have a substantial impact on the value-at-risk (VAR) of a credit portfolio or the prices of credit derivatives such as collateralized debt obligations (D+CDOs). In this book the authors develop a much more sophisticated analysis of migration behavior. Their contribution of more sophisticated techniques to measure and forecast changes in migration behavior as well as determining adequate estimators for transition matrices is a major contribution to rating based credit modeling. *Internal ratings-based systems are widely used in banks to calculate their value-at-risk (VAR) in order to determine their capital requirements for loan and bond portfolios under Basel II *One aspect of these ratings systems is credit migrations, addressed in a systematic and comprehensive way for the first time in this book *The book is based on in-depth work by Trueck and Rachev,","2009-01-15","http://books.google.es/books?id=C8mxdgm_K8EC&pg=PA55&dq=riskiness+%2B+structure&hl=&cd=27&source=gbs_api","9780080920306",

The Measurement of Market Risk reviews the probabilistic modelling of so-called risk factors, which represent the uncertainty of financial markets, and discusses the issue of risk as the perception of uncertainty by individuals when faced with a decision problem. Further, the book discusses the pricing of financial instruments as a function of risk factors. Emphasis is put on options, because they exhibit a non-linear exposure to the risk factors. The core of the text is the assessment of risk for financial portfolios by way of estimating the portfolio probability distribution. A new approach, the Barycentric Discretisation with Piecewise Quadratic Approximation (BDPQA), which poses no assumptions on the risk factor distribution and accounts for the non-linearity of the price functions, is introduced.","2001-07-03","http://books.google.es/books?id=OZwNgx1DqXYC&pg=PA11&dq=riskiness+%2B+structure&hl=&cd=31&source=gbs_api","3540421432",

Implications for Corporate Finance Decisions","riskiness + structure","[Univ.-Prof. Dr. Paul Wentges, Gregor Gossy]","[Banks and banking]","Ordinarily, only the interests of shareholders, debtholders, and corporate management are taken into account when analyzing corporate financial decisions while the interests of non-financial stakeholders are often neglected. Gregor Gossy develops a so-called stakeholder rationale for risk management arguing that firms which are more dependent on implicit claims from their non-financial stakeholders, such as customers, suppliers, and employees, prefer conservative financial policies. In order to perform panel data analyses of the determinants of corporate financial decisions, the author uses data from Austrian and German industrial companies. He shows that variables for a firm's most important non-financial stakeholders explain the firm's capital structure and cash holding decisions. His findings suggest that a firm's choice of accounting standards have a moderating effect on the determinants of corporate finance decisions.","2008-09-08","http://books.google.es/books?id=GgIR4Nxc-F8C&pg=PA74&dq=riskiness+%2B+structure&hl=&cd=35&source=gbs_api","9783834997586",

When banks can adjust their capital structures, a monetary easing leads to greater leverage and lower monitoring. However, if a bank's capital structure is fixed, the balance depends on the degree of bank capitalization: when facing a policy rate cut, well capitalized banks decrease monitoring, while highly levered banks increase it. Further, the balance of these effects depends on the structure and contestability of the banking industry, and is therefore likely to vary across countries and over time.","2010-12-01","http://books.google.es/books?id=3LCr5zsuDHMC&pg=PA6&dq=riskiness+%2B+structure&hl=&cd=39&source=gbs_api","9781455211593",

"An Interpretation of Desire. Essays in the Study of Sexuality","riskiness + structures","[John Gagnon]","[Psychology]","An Interpretation of Desire offers a bracing collection of major essays by John Gagnon, one of the leading and most inspiring figures in sexual research. Spanning his work from the 1970s, when he explored the idea that sexuality is mediated through social processes and categories—thus paving the way for Foucault—and then extending through his turn to issues of desire during the 1990s, these essays constitute an essential entrée to the study of sexuality in the twentieth century. Gagnon may be best known as the coauthor of Sexual Conduct—a book that introduced the seminal concept of sexual scripting—and as one of the coauthors of The Social Organization of Sexuality, a foundational work that is widely considered to be the most important study of human sexual behavior since the Kinsey report. The essays collected here first trace the influence of scripting theory on Gagnon, outlining the radical departure he took from the dominant biological and psychiatric models of sex research. The volume then turns to more recent essays that consider such vexed issues as homosexuality, the theories of Sigmund Freud, HIV, hazardous sex, and the social aspects of sexually transmitted diseases.","2004","http://books.google.es/books?id=PHCsQOW61VMC&pg=PA222&dq=riskiness+%2B+structures&hl=&cd=4&source=gbs_api","0226278581",

Increasingly, professionals in corporate finance need to understand the workings of the credit risk market in order to successfully manage risk in their own organizations; in addition, some wish to move into the field on a full-time basis. Most books in the field, however, are either too academic for working professionals, or written for those who already possess extensive experience in the area. Credit Derivatives fills the gap, explaining the credit risk market clearly and simply, in language any working financial professional can understand. Harvard Business School faculty member George C. Chacko and his colleagues begin by explaining the underlying principles surrounding credit risk. Next, they systematically present today's leading methods and instruments for managing it. The authors introduce total return swaps, credit spread options, credit linked notes, and other instruments, demonstrating how each of them can be used to isolate risk and sell it to someone willing to accept it.","2006-06-02","http://books.google.es/books?id=nCyDSVcd_G8C&pg=SA2-PA28&dq=riskiness+%2B+structures&hl=&cd=20&source=gbs_api","9780132715928",

The authors, coming from two very different disciplinary traditions, meet this challenge by building bridges between the engineering, the statistical and the social science perspectives.

A basic pillar for the book is the risk governance framework proposed by the International Risk Governance Council (IRGC). This framework offers a comprehensive means of integrating risk identification, assessment, management and communication. The authors develop and explain new insights and add substance to the various elements of the framework. The theoretical analysis is illustrated by several examples from different areas of applications.","2010-09-27","http://books.google.es/books?id=M0eTe0E4mWMC&pg=PA38&dq=riskiness+%2B+structures&hl=&cd=39&source=gbs_api","3642139264",

"Markets on Trial. The Economic Sociology of the U.S. Financial Crisis","riskiness + network","[Michael Lounsbury, Paul Morris Hirsch]","[Political Science]","Since the mid-20th century, organizational theorists have increasingly distanced themselves from the study of core societal power centers and important policy issues of the day. This has been driven by a shift away from the study of organizations, politics, and society and towards a more narrow focus on instrumental exchange and performance. As a result, our field has become increasingly impotent as a critical voice and contributor to policy. For a contemporary example, witness our inability as a field to make sense of the recent U.S. mortgage meltdown and concomitant global financial crisis. It is not that economic and organizational sociologists have nothing to say. The problem is that while we have a great deal of knowledge about finance, the economy, entrepreneurship and corporations, we fail to address how the knowledge in our field can be used to contribute to important policy issues of the day. This double-volume brings together some of the very top scholars in the world in economic and organizational sociology to address the recent global financial crisis debates and struggles around how to organize economies and societies around the world.","2010","http://books.google.es/books?id=dAzpu1N-nFAC&pg=PA294&dq=riskiness+%2B+network&hl=&cd=5&source=gbs_api","9780857242051",

"Financial Systems in Troubled Waters. Information, Strategies, and Governance to Enhance Performances in Risky Times","riskiness + network","[Alessandro Carretta, Gianluca Mattarocci]","[Business & Economics]","This collection considers the financial crisis from a managerial perspective, focussing on the business implications for the financial industry. Topics examined include governance, information needs and strategy of financial intermediaries and investors. The contributions build on the existing literature and present some unique insights on governance, credit quality evaluation and performance measurement. In a fast growing or steady market, it is possible for even an inefficient financial system to satisfy investors’ and firms’ needs. However, the current financial crisis has brought into sharp relief the limits of the inefficient practices adopted by the market, and made clear the importance of developing more effective governance mechanisms, more detailed and complete information databases and new strategies. The crisis has also brought to the fore issues about the governance of financial intermediaries that had not been previously addressed. These include board diversity, internal monitoring procedures and the existence of interlocking directorates. More broadly, the financial crisis has radically altered the international framework, with an increasingly consolidated financial sector, and the rise of new markets (such as China) that now play a predominant role in the worldwide market. Studies on the competition and on the performance in this new scenario are essential in order to understand the implications of recent events.","2013-04-26","http://books.google.es/books?id=a7hTEEwu_o8C&pg=PA105&dq=riskiness+%2B+network&hl=&cd=15&source=gbs_api","1136232249",

"Switching Channels. Organization and Change in TV Broadcasting","riskiness + network","[Richard E CAVES, Richard E Caves, Karen Guo]","[Philosophy]","Media critics invariably disparage the quality of programming produced by the U.S. television industry. But why the industry produces what it does is a question largely unasked. It is this question, at the crux of American popular culture, that ""Switching Channels"" explores. In the past twenty-five years, the expansion of cable and satellite systems has transformed television. Richard Caves examines the economics of this phenomenon--and the nature and logic of the broadcast networks' response to the incursion of cable TV, especially the shift to inexpensive unscripted game and ""reality"" shows and ""news"" magazines. An explanation of these changes, Caves argues, requires an understanding of two very different sectors: the ""creative industry,"" which produces programs; and the commercial channels, which bring them to viewers. His book shows how distributors' judgment of profitability determines the quality and character of the programs the creative industry produces. This determination, writes Caves, depends on the number and types of viewers that various programs can attract and advertisers' willingness to pay for their attention, as well as the organization of the networks that package programs, the distributors that transmit them, and the deals these parties strike with one another.","2009-06-30","http://books.google.es/books?id=aKDW1OKSOLAC&pg=PA160&dq=riskiness+%2B+network&hl=&cd=17&source=gbs_api","0674029291",

In this book Professors Alan Rugman and Joseph D'Cruz bridge the literature on networks and multinationals by introducing the new concept of the flagship firm. In each business network strategic leadership is provided by the flagship firm, which is defined as a multinational enterprise. It has other partners: key suppliers; key customers; key competitors; and key partners in the non-business infrastructure. These business networks are usually located in the 'triad' regions of the European Union, North America, and Japan. There are strong cross-border network linkages within these regions, but less globalization than regional economic integration. The theory of the flagship firm/five partners model is applied to the telecommunications, chemicals, automotive, and electronics sectors, amongst others, and the book reports on both empirical studies and field research of the international competitiveness of these sectors.

"Critical Visions. New Directions in Social Theory","riskiness + network","[Anthony Elliott]","[Social Science]","In this remarkable book, Anthony Elliott develops a wide-ranging analysis of key issues and debates in contemporary social theory. Drawing social theory, cultural studies, and psychoanalysis together in a bold configuration, Elliott challenges the widespread view that social theory seems to have lost its way as a result of the diversification of conceptual approaches. In outlining an approach that places imagination and creativity at the center of social theory, Elliott argues that theoretical pluralism from post-structuralism to postmodernism, from psychoanalysis to deconstruction represents not the demise, but the renewal of critical social theory. Elliott opens with critical readings of the terrain of contemporary social theory and theorists, among them Ulrich Beck, Anthony Giddens, Jurgen Habermas, Jacques Lacan, Cornelius Castoriadis, and Julia Kristeva. He follows with an analysis of key debates in critical social theory. Questions relating to the globalization of risk, citizenship, morality and ethics, politics and norms, and sexuality and desire are all explored. This book is essential reading for students seeking a broad understanding of the confluence of sociology, social theory, politics, and cultural studies.","2003-01-01","http://books.google.es/books?id=wslr_Esvs1UC&pg=PA10&dq=riskiness+%2B+network&hl=&cd=31&source=gbs_api","0742526909",

"Innovation and the Future Proof Bank. A Practical Guide to Doing Different Business-as-Usual","riskiness + network","[James A Gardner]","[Business & Economics]","Innovation, the conversion of the new to business as usual, is a very special business process. It is the business process able to reprogram all others. Creating the practices that make this process work is a key challenge for all in financial services that are worried about responding to the future. When an institution can identify things that are outside its present practices and convert them, production line style, into products, processes, cultural changes, or new markets, it will never be outpaced by internal or external change again. The institution becomes ""FutureProof"". This is a book about those practices in banks. It explains, using examples from institutions around the world, what it takes to create an innovation culture that consistently introduces new things into undifferentiated markets and internal cultures. It shows how banks can leverage the power of the new to establish unexpected revenue lines, or make old ones grow. And it provides advice on the social and political factors that either help or hinder the germination of the new in banks. Moreover, though, this is a book about the science of innovation in a banking context. Drawing from practices already highly developed in financial services—managing portfolios of assets to mitigate risk—it explains how practitioners can run their innovations groups like any other business line in the bank one that delivers a return on investment predictably and at high multiples of internal cost of capital. For leaders, Innovation and the Future Proof Bank provides the diagnostic tools to guide benchmarking and investment decisions for the innovation function. And for innovation practitioners, the book lays out everything needed to make sure that converting the new to business as usual is predictable, measurable, and profitable.","2011-04-20","http://books.google.es/books?id=dXoYuInfkP0C&pg=PT79&dq=riskiness+%2B+network&hl=&cd=34&source=gbs_api","9780470685211",

An Interaction and Network Perspective","riskiness + network","[Kristian Möller, David T Wilson]","[Business & Economics]","This book provides an in-depth understanding of long term business relationships in industrial markets. During the late 1980s our view on business marketing changed remarkably: from a single transaction oriented, market mechanism-based description of marketing and purchasing we are moving into domestic and international buyer--seller relationships. In academic terms, we are experiencing a broadening of the paradigms that describe how companies interact. Business Marketing: An Interaction and Network Perspective provides an in-depth understanding of the long-term relations in business marketing, how these relationships develop, and their constituent parts and processes. Unfolding network theory is presented and applied to the description of how complex interdependencies between modern firms in international markets can be analyzed with the help of network concepts. Business Marketing: An Interaction and Network Perspective is suitable for graduate and doctoral level courses in business administration.

"Making Inclusion Work. Experiences from Academia Around the World","riskiness + network","[Saija Katila, Susan Meriläinen, Janne Tienari]","[Business & Economics]","Full of insights for any organizational scholar still hoping to make a difference for a better world, this greatly illuminating book examines what it takes to intervene critically but positively in the mainstream of a globalized academic life, and be able to survive such interventions. The contributors offer tried and tested approaches neither aggressive nor confrontational allowing them to bring inclusion and multiplicity to their teaching and their research while carving spaces for action and resistance to hegemonic academic practices. An innovative must read and much needed text! Marta B. Calás, University of Massachusetts, US This important book should be required reading for all management educators. Starting from an incisive and timely critique of the increasingly standardized global academic system, the editors set out to offer an inclusive vision of what education can be. A rich array of contributors from diverse cultures and perspectives offer experiences and ideas about the practice of inclusive education and, perhaps more importantly, offer some hope that the logic of standardization is not immutable. Christopher Grey, University of Warwick, UK This innovative book explores how inclusion can be enhanced in academia by considering the strategic work of expert academics from around the world. It offers a new look at academic work through the accounts of passionate practitioners who have each, in their own ways, made inclusion work. Making Inclusion Work exemplifies how academics can meaningfully engage in inclusive practices in their everyday work. Scholars around the world share their experiences of intervening in curriculum development, teaching and research, and reflect on practices that have worked in local contexts. The authors discuss the process for reaching greater inclusion which begins with an honest appraisal of current local practice. Reflective developers in academic institutions and educational administration will appreciate the unique insights provided by this book. Students interested in diversity and inclusion, academic practices, and autobiographical action-oriented research will also find the contributions invaluable.","2010-01-01","http://books.google.es/books?id=fXIivy2SZaUC&pg=PA164&dq=riskiness+%2B+network&hl=&cd=37&source=gbs_api","9781849806862",
"Legal Secrets. Equality and Efficiency in the Common Law","riskiness + network","[Kim Lane Scheppele]","[Law]","Does the seller of a house have to tell the buyer that the water is turned off twelve hours a day? Does the buyer of a great quantity of tobacco have to inform the seller that the military blockade of the local port, which had depressed tobacco sales and lowered prices, is about to end? Courts say yes in the first case, no in the second. How can we understand the difference in judgments? And what does it say about whether the psychiatrist should disclose to his patient's girlfriend that the patient wants to kill her? Kim Lane Scheppele answers the question, Which secrets are legal secrets and what makes them so? She challenges the economic theory of law, which argues that judges decide cases in ways that maximize efficiency, and she shows that judges use equality as an important principle in their decisions. In the course of thinking about secrets, Scheppele also explores broader questions about judicial reasoning—how judges find meaning in legal texts and how they infuse every fact summary with the values of their legal culture. Finally, the specific insights about secrecy are shown to be consistent with a general moral theory of law that indicates what the content of law should be if the law is to be legitimate, a theory that sees legal justification as the opportunity to attract consent. This is more than a book about secrets. It is also a book about the limits of an economic view of law. Ultimately, it is a work in constructive legal theory, one that draws on moral philosophy, sociology, economics, and political theory to develop a new view of legal interpretation and legal morality.","1988-01","http://books.google.es/books?id=tBTCg-GFpacC&pg=PA50&dq=riskiness+%2B+network&hl=&cd=38&source=gbs_api","0226737799",
"Financial Statecraft. The Role of Financial Markets in American Foreign Policy","riskiness + network","[Benn Steil, Robert E. Litan]","[Business & Economics]","divAs trade flows expanded and trade agreements proliferated after World War II, governments—most notably the United States—came increasingly to use their power over imports and exports to influence the behavior of other countries. But trade is not the only way in which nations interact economically. Over the past two decades, another form of economic exchange has risen to a level of vastly greater significance and political concern: the purchase and sale of financial assets across borders. Nearly $2 trillion worth of currency now moves cross-border every day, roughly 90 percent of which is accounted for by financial flows unrelated to trade in goods and services—a stunning inversion of the figures in 1970. The time is ripe to ask fundamental questions about what Benn Steil and Robert Litan have coined as “financial statecraft,” or those aspects of economic statecraft directed at influencing international capital flows. How precisely has the American government practiced financial statecraft? How effective have these efforts been? And how can they be made more effective?

Despite the utility of supportive working relationships and despite extensive consulting activity on leadership and team building, employees complain extensively about mistreatment by their bosses and colleagues. Analyzing and Theorizing the Dynamics of the Workplace Incivility Crisis presents a theoretic framework for considering the fundamental issues of group dynamics and individual psychology that lie behind this ongoing workplace incivility crisis. It contextualizes the need for belonging as a motivation that shapes expressed social behaviour and intensifies received social behaviour. Looking at cognitive elements as well as rudeness rationales that pertain to workplace incivility and its justification, this work maps social constructs, including the role of team leadership, that lead to setting implicit social norms. In addition to formulating a theoretical framework, Analyzing and Theorizing the Dynamics of the Workplace Incivility Crisis considers methods to address the dynamics that perpetuate incivility at work and actively points at setting an action agenda to evaluate their impact.""--","2012-10-24","http://books.google.es/books?id=bfMXEW2HKrMC&pg=PA41&dq=riskiness+%2B+network&hl=&cd=40&source=gbs_api","9789400755710",

Groundbreaking developments in adolescent brain research underpin this straightforward guide to understanding—and dealing with—teen behavior. Adolescence has long been characterized as the “storm and stress” years, and with recent developments in digital communication, it seems today’s teens are in for a more complicated journey than ever before. Even the most sympathetic, “in-touch” parents might throw their hands up in frustration at their teen’s unpredictable and risky behavior and ask: what are they thinking?! It turns out that teens’ thrill-seeking activities and quests for independence aren’t just the result of raging hormones, but rather typical effects of the unique structure and development of the adolescent brain. In easily navigable chapters full of practical anecdotes and examples, acclaimed scientists Aaron White and Scott Swartzwelder draw from the most recent studies on the teen brain to illuminate the complexities of issues such as school, driving, social networking, video games, and mental health in kids whose crucial brain connections are just coming online.","2013-04-22","http://books.google.es/books?id=YtuABan1askC&printsec=frontcover&dq=riskiness+%2B+networks&hl=&cd=4&source=gbs_api","9780393089950",

"Youth Risk-Taking Behavior in Brazil: Drug Use and Teenage Pregnancy","riskiness + networks","[Ana Rute Cardoso]","[Adolescent Health]","Abstract: Using an extensive survey that addresses risk factors faced by the population in the shantytowns (favelas) of Fortaleza, Brazil, the aim of this paper is to study risk-taking behavior by youth, focusing on drug use and teenage pregnancy. The paper analyzes the impact of factors such as exposure to mass media, the existence of support networks, self-esteem, and the occurrence of violence at home and in the neighborhood, on the probability of risk-taking behavior. A bivariate probit model is estimated. The findings indicate that reliance on support networks and exposure to mass media are associated with a lower probability of either type of risk behavior. Living in a violent home increases drug consumption. Race does not have a significant impact on either type of behavior.","2007","http://books.google.es/books?id=5d286FT56sAC&pg=PA10&dq=riskiness+%2B+networks&hl=&cd=30&source=gbs_api","Youth Risk-Taking B",

In the last two decades, however, repression seems to have given way to its exact opposite. But where did this “repression” originate?

Based on solid ethnographic and historical analysis of sexual morality in rural Ireland, augmented by comparative data from Papua New Guinea, and being informed by from Freud’s emblematic concept of repression, the author draws new conclusions that not only apply to the specific case of his Irish material but shed new light on the specific nature of an anthropological approach to the study of human societies.","2002","http://books.google.es/books?id=2PKakugIWNYC&printsec=frontcover&dq=riskiness+%2B+networks&hl=&cd=33&source=gbs_api","1571813195",

"Valuation of Network Effects in Software Markets. A Complex Networks Approach","riskiness + networks","[Andreas Kemper]","[Business & Economics]","The customer base is an important value driver of software companies and a reliable prediction of its development is fundamental for investment decisions. A particularity in software markets is that an individual s purchasing decision is often influenced by other users choices. Although such customer network effects are evident, their quantitative assessment remain elusive with conventional approaches. This book contributes to closing this gap by developing methods for measuring network effects and their implications for valuation in software markets. Based on the theory of complex networks the book reveals that such diffusion processes highly depend on structural properties of customer networks. Moreover, it depicts that such insights are contributions to improve the quality of valuations in software markets. But the implications of this research also comprise social and political aspects as they can be applied in order to prevent corporate failures in all network effect markets.","2009-12-12","http://books.google.es/books?id=isdza0IiXbUC&pg=PA21&dq=riskiness+%2B+networks&hl=&cd=40&source=gbs_api","3790823678",

At the same time, infrastructure systems in developed countries are deteriorating and in need of renewal. Today, many of the engineering and economic problems surrounding infrastructure construction projects have been solved, but the threat of social misalignments and political conflicts renders the development and management of such projects more challenging than ever before. This book presents a new theoretical framework that allows us to analyze the institutional and social movement processes, both negative and positive, that surround global infrastructure projects as they confront cross-national and cross-sectoral (such as private-public partnerships) institutional differences. The value of this framework is illustrated through a series of studies on a wide range of infrastructure projects, including roads, railroads, ports, airports, water supply and energy pipelines.","2011-06-23","http://books.google.es/books?id=jQK-HsgPnoYC&pg=PA375&dq=riskiness+%2B+networked&hl=&cd=29&source=gbs_api","9781139497442",

"Architectural Design and Regulation","riskiness + networked","[Rob Imrie, Emma Street]","[Architecture]","From the earliest periods of architecture and building, architects’ actions have been conditioned by rules, regulations, standards, and governance practices. These range from socio-cultural and religious codes seeking to influence the formal structure of settlement patterns, to prescriptive building regulations specifying detailed elements of design in relation to the safety of building structures. In Architectural Design and Regulation the authors argue that the rule and regulatory basis of architecture is part of a broader field of socio-institutional and political interventions in the design and development process that serve to delimit, and define, the scope of the activities of architects. The book explores how the practices of architects are embedded in complex systems of rules and regulations. The authors develop the understanding that the rules and regulations of building form and performance ought not to be counterpoised as external to creative processes and practices, but as integral to the creation of well-designed places. The contribution of Architectural Design and Regulation is to show that far from the rule and regulatory basis of architecture undermining the capacities of architects to design, they are the basis for new and challenging activities that open up possibilities for reinventing the actions of architects.","2011-01-21","http://books.google.es/books?id=ZJHFiFC63hEC&pg=PT164&dq=riskiness+%2B+networked&hl=&cd=35&source=gbs_api","9781444393149",

The first book was written parallel to major developments in the science of risk assessment following the introduction of EU-legislation on industrial chemicals in the period 1970-1995. The present edition reflects the progress and experience since 1995 and again aims at providing background and training material for a new generation of risk assessors, specifically for those who will be involved in implementing legislation in the EU (REACH, the new legislative framework for industrial chemicals) and, in addition, the USA, Japan and Canada. The book is an introduction to risk assessment of chemicals and contains basic background information on sources, emissions, distribution and fate processes for the estimation of exposure of plant and animal species in the environment and humans exposed via the environment, consumer products, and at the workplace. This book includes chapters on environmental chemistry, toxicology and ecotoxicology as well as information on data requirements, data estimation methodologies and intelligent testing strategies. It describes the basic principles and methods of risk assessment in the legislative frameworks of the EU, USA, Japan, and Canada. It also provides an overview of the OECD Chemicals Program. The book is intended to be used by those who are involved in risk assessment of chemicals in government, research institutes, academia and industry as well as by students in technology, health and environmental sciences.","2007-09-18","http://books.google.es/books?id=-ltZ0K1TcqAC&pg=PA3&dq=riskiness+%2B+ecosystem&hl=&cd=5&source=gbs_api","1402061013",

"The Development of University-based Entrepreneurship Ecosystems. Global Practices","riskiness + ecosystem","[Michael Fetters, Patricia G. Greene, Mark P. Rice]","[Business & Economics]","Entrepreneurship and innovation are increasingly viewed as key contributors to global economic and social development. University-based entrepreneurship ecosystems (U-BEEs) provide a supportive context in which entrepreneurship and innovation can thrive. In that vein, this book provides critical insight based on cutting-edge analyses of how to frame, design, launch, and sustain efforts in the area of entrepreneurship. Seven success factors were derived from an in-depth analysis of six leading, and very different, university-based entrepreneurship ecosystems in North America, Latin America, Europe, and Asia. These seven success factors are: (1) senior leadership vision, engagement and sponsorship; (2) strong programmatic and faculty leadership; (3) sustained commitment over a long period of time; (4) commitment of substantial financial resources; (5) commitment to continuing innovation in curriculum and programs; (6) an appropriate organizational infrastructure; and (7) commitment to building the extended enterprise and achieving critical mass. Based on these success factors, the authors provide a series of recommendations for the development of a comprehensive university-based entrepreneurship ecosystem. This major assessment of how best to drive university-based entrepreneurship ecosystems is essential reading for anyone involved in higher education (particularly provosts, deans, and professors), government agencies concerned with socio-economic development, and all those concerned with helping entrepreneurship ecosystems to flourish.","2010-01-01","http://books.google.es/books?id=IGnx8L_1I8YC&pg=PA174&dq=riskiness+%2B+ecosystem&hl=&cd=15&source=gbs_api","9781849805896",

In this book ecological and societal aspects are for the first time treated together. In an ecological approach the aim is to evaluate the significance of certain biological properties like biodiversity and natural habitats. Also, it is important to see biological control from an organic (or ecological) farming point of view. In a societal approach terms like 'consumer's attitude', 'risk perception', 'learning and education' and 'value triangle' are recognised as significant for biological production and human welfare.","2007-01-29","http://books.google.es/books?id=u0SD6MZ2QcoC&pg=PA52&dq=riskiness+%2B+ecosystem&hl=&cd=17&source=gbs_api","9781402044014",

"Ecological Intelligence. How Knowing the Hidden Impacts of What We Buy Can Change Everything","riskiness + ecosystem","[Daniel Goleman]","[Business & Economics]","The bestselling author of Emotional Intelligence and Primal Leadership now brings us Ecological Intelligence—revealing the hidden environmental consequences of what we make and buy, and how with that knowledge we can drive the essential changes we all must make to save our planet and ourselves. We buy “herbal” shampoos that contain industrial chemicals that can threaten our health or contaminate the environment. We dive down to see coral reefs, not realizing that an ingredient in our sunscreen feeds a virus that kills the reef. We wear organic cotton t-shirts, but don’t know that its dyes may put factory workers at risk for leukemia. In Ecological Intelligence, Daniel Goleman reveals why so many of the products that are labeled green are a “mirage,” and illuminates our wild inconsistencies in response to the ecological crisis. Drawing on cutting-edge research, Goleman explains why we as shoppers are in the dark over the hidden impacts of the goods and services we make and consume, victims of a blackout of information about the detrimental effects of producing, shipping, packaging, distributing, and discarding the goods we buy. But the balance of power is about to shift from seller to buyer, as a new generation of technologies informs us of the ecological facts about products at the point of purchase. This “radical transparency” will enable consumers to make smarter purchasing decisions, and will drive companies to rethink and reform their businesses, ushering in, Goleman claims, a new age of competitive advantage.","2009-04-21","http://books.google.es/books?id=8wZbEcJsi94C&pg=PA147&dq=riskiness+%2B+ecosystem&hl=&cd=22&source=gbs_api","0385530404",

"The Price of Precaution and the Ethics of Risk","riskiness + ecosystem","[Christian Munthe]","[Electronic books]","Christian Munthe undertakes an innovative, in-depth philosophical analysis of what the idea of a precautionary principle is and should be about. A novel theory of the ethics of imposing risks is developed and used as a foundation for defending the idea of precaution in environmental and technological policy making against its critics, while at the same time avoiding a number of identified flaws. The theory is shown to have far-reaching practical conclusions for areas such as bio-, information- and nuclear technology, and global environmental policy in areas such as climate change. The author argues that, while the price we pay for precaution must not be too high, we have to be prepared to pay it in order to act ethically defensible. A number of practical suggestions for precautionary regulation and policy making are made on the basis of this, and some challenges to basic ethical theory as well as consumerist societies, the global political order and liberal democracy are identified.Munthe’s book is a well-argued contribution to the PP debate, putting neglected justificatory and methodological questions at the forefront. His many discussions of alternative accounts as well as his drawing out the consequences of his own suggestion in practical cases give the reader a thorough, holistic sense of what justification of PP amounts to. /..../ Munthe’s main case, his argumentation for the requirement of precaution as a moral norm, is convincing and puts a strong pressure on too narrow alternative suggestions on how it should be perceived and justified, and he launches a plausible defence of its practical usability.","2011-05-19","http://books.google.es/books?id=mOPdO9vq0j0C&pg=PA120&dq=riskiness+%2B+ecosystem&hl=&cd=24&source=gbs_api","9400713304",

With the establishment of a number of institutions for funding the projects including the World Bank, Asian Development Bank, and many other agencies, the need to develop mechanisms to assess economically viable projects is more important than ever. The Social-Cost Benefit Analysis (SCBA) is an important technique used in formulating, appraising, and evaluating projects. It is a facet of applied welfare economics which is increasingly being used to identify and assess public projects in both developing and developed countries. This volume presents a comprehensive view of cost-benefit analysis in its theoretical and applied dimensions. Both theory and case studies are presented. The theoretical setting for Cost-Benefit Analysis is established by the first five chapters-""Spatial General Equilibrium and Cost-Benefit Analysis,"" by David M. Newbery; ""Optimum Growth Theory and Social Time Preference: A Computerized Mathematical Modeling Exercise to Choose a Social Discount Rate,"" by Sardar M. N.

"Understanding Risk. Informing Decisions in a Democratic Society","riskiness + ecosystems","[Committee on Risk Characterization, Board on Environmental Change and Society, Division of Behavioral and Social Sciences and Education, National Research Council]","[Political Science]","Understanding Risk addresses a central dilemma of risk decisionmaking in a democracy: detailed scientific and technical information is essential for making decisions, but the people who make and live with those decisions are not scientists. The key task of risk characterization is to provide needed and appropriate information to decisionmakers and the public. This important new volume illustrates that making risks understandable to the public involves much more than translating scientific knowledge. The volume also draws conclusions about what society should expect from risk characterization and offers clear guidelines and principles for informing the wide variety of risk decisions that face our increasingly technological society. Understanding Risk Frames fundamental questions about what risk characterization means. Reviews traditional definitions and explores new conceptual and practical approaches. Explores how risk characterization should inform decisionmakers and the public. Looks at risk characterization in the context of the entire decisionmaking process. Understanding Risk discusses how risk characterization has fallen short in many recent controversial decisions. Throughout the text, examples and case studies--such as planning for the long-term ecological health of the Everglades or deciding on the operation of a waste incinerator--bring key concepts to life. Understanding Risk will be important to anyone involved in risk issues: federal, state, and local policymakers and regulators; risk managers; scientists; industrialists; researchers; and concerned individuals.","1996-06-19","http://books.google.es/books?id=wj-cB_-ms58C&pg=PA52&dq=riskiness+%2B+ecosystems&hl=&cd=15&source=gbs_api","0309133246",

Working with and in schools, neighborhood organizations, religious institutions, social programs, and government agencies, the community psychologist has come to understand how social settings and social policy influence behavior and foster change that promotes individual health and well-being. Using a social ecological paradigm as their guiding framework, they focus on the interactions between persons and their environments, cultural diversity, and local empowerment for understanding organizational, community, and social change. Community psychologists have relied on multiple methods of obtaining data but more often, they have had to develop new methodologies or adapt existing ones.

To know without fear of failure is to expect that experience will confound our confident claims to knowledge. And the universal character of all life involves acting, discovering what happens as a result, and incorporating both intention and result into a new comprehensive understanding. Burbidge explores how Hegel applied this approach when he turned from his logic to chemistry, biology, psychology and history, and suggests how a Hegelian might function within the changed circumstances of contemporary science.","2007-06-15","http://books.google.es/books?id=FPLWAAAAMAAJ&q=contingency+%2B+systemic&dq=contingency+%2B+systemic&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api","0230527523",

"To Keep or To Change First Past The Post? : The Politics of Electoral Reform. The Politics of Electoral Reform","contingency + systemic","[André Blais]","[Political Science]","First past the post is one of the oldest and simplest electoral systems. The logic is simple: the candidate with the most votes wins. It is the system in place in some of the oldest democracies, most especially the United States and the United Kingdom, as well as the largest democracy, India. This is also a system that is hotly debated, and proposals for reform are often advanced. This book addresses the following questions: What fosters or hinders reform of first past the post? When and why does reform emerge on the political agenda? Who proposes and who opposes reform? When and why do reform proposals succeed or fail? What kind of proposal tends to be put on the table? Are some types of proposal more likely to succeed? Why? The first chapter undertakes a comparative analysis of the conditions under which reform is initiated. The following chapters investigate in detail the politics of electoral reform in the United Kingdom, the United States, Canada, and New Zealand, the debates that take place, the proposals that are advanced, and the strategies deployed by the actors. These analyses contribute to a rich and nuanced understanding of why first past the post is often challenged and sometimes replaced.","2008-05-08","http://books.google.es/books?id=j4Tb3qusKD8C&pg=PA224&dq=contingency+%2B+systemic&hl=&cd=5&source=gbs_api","9780191561566",

His pioneering work, Postmodernism, or, The Cultural Logic of Late Capitalism, has been widely acclaimed as the classic analysis of postmodernity, examined with an intellectual courage and skill that dared to interconnect cultural, historical, political, economic and philosophical perspectives. Jameson’s constantly enriched reflections have become an essential reference point for all those attempting to grapple with the postmodern. However, until now, several of his key writings on the subject, from initial formulations to current developments, have been unavailable in an accessible form. This collection vividly illuminates the cultural turn of contemporary capitalism. Thus it includes his earliest insights, his responses to critics, his survey of alternative interpretations and his earliest insights, his responses to critics, his survey of alternative interpretations and his engagement with the cultural climate of the 1990s. The collection, introduced by Perry Anderson, includes a number of recent texts in which Jameson extends his method to new aspects of postmodern architecture and its relationship to political economy. The Cultural Turn is an indispensable guide to the thought of the most arresting and impressive theorist of postmodernism.","1998","http://books.google.es/books?id=oBaVWr2tb10C&pg=PA175&dq=contingency+%2B+systemic&hl=&cd=6&source=gbs_api","1859841821",
"Translation and the Westernization of Eighteenth-Century Russia. a Social-Systemic Perspective","contingency + systemic","[Sergey Tyulenev]","[Russia]","The book considers the role of translation in the reformation of Russia along Western European lines in the eighteenth century. Translation is presented as a key social-systemic factor in the dynamics of the relationship between the system and its environment - between Russia and Western Europe. The author draws on contemporary historiography and social theory, primarily Niklas Luhmann's social systems theory, but also concepts of other sociologists and historians, such as Gumilev, Bourdieu, Habermas, Jameson, amongst others. This allows the author to conduct a comprehensive analysis of social involvements of translation. Importantly, this case study aspires to pave the way for research of the social role of translation of universal validity. Sergey Tyulenev has taught at the University of Moscow, McGill University, and the University of Cambridge. Now, he is a post-doctoral researcher with the University of the Free State (South Africa). He has published several monographs and a number of articles on the theory and history of translation.

Dichotomous views of development still underlie many fundamental debates in the biological and social sciences. Developmental systems theory (DST) offers a new conceptual framework with which to resolve such debates. DST views ontogeny as contingent cycles of interaction among a varied set of developmental resources, no one of which controls the process. These factors include DNA, cellular and organismic structure, and social and ecological interactions. DST has excited interest from a wide range of researchers, from molecular biologists to anthropologists, because of its ability to integrate evolutionary theory and other disciplines without falling into traditional oppositions.The book provides historical background to DST, recent theoretical findings on the mechanisms of heredity, applications of the DST framework to behavioral development, implications of DST for the philosophy of biology, and critical reactions to DST.","2003-01","http://books.google.es/books?id=aVdw3VLRqYsC&pg=PA355&dq=contingency+%2B+systemic&hl=&cd=10&source=gbs_api","0262650630",

"Agency, Contingency and Census Process. Observations of the 2006 Indigenous Enumeration Strategy in Remote Aboriginal Australia","contingency + systemic","[Frances Morphy]","[Aboriginal Australians]","The Indigenous Enumeration Strategy (IES) of the Australian National Census of Population and Housing has evolved over the years in response to the perceived 'difference' of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander populations. Its defining characteristics are the use of locally recruited, mostly Indigenous collector interviewers, and the administration of a modified collection instrument in discrete Indigenous communities, mostly in remote Australia. The research reported here is unique. The authors, with the assistance of the Australian Bureau of Statistics, were able to follow the workings of the IES in the 2006 Census from the design of the collection instrument to the training of temporary census field staff at the Northern Territory's Census Management Unit in Darwin, to the enumeration in four remote locations, through to the processing stage at the Data Processing Centre in Melbourne. This allowed the tracking of data from collection to processing, and an assessment of the effects of information flows on the quality of the data, both as input and output. This study of the enumeration involved four very different locations: a group of small outstation communities (Arnhem Land), a large Aboriginal township (Wadeye), an 'open' town with a majority Aboriginal population (Fitzroy Crossing), and the minority Aboriginal population of a major regional centre (Alice Springs). A comparison between these contexts reveals differences that reflect the diversity of remote Aboriginal Australia, but also commonalities that exert a powerful influence on the effectiveness of the IES, in particular very high levels of short-term mobility. The selection of sites also allowed a comparison between the enumeration process in the Northern Territory, where a time-extended rolling count was explicitly planned for, and Western Australia, where a modified form of the standard count had been envisaged. The findings suggest that the IES has reached a point in its development where the injection of ever-increasing resources into essentially the same generic set and structure of activities may be producing diminishing returns. There is a need for a new kind of engagement between the Australian Bureau of Statistics and local government and Indigenous community-sector organisations in remote Australia. The agency and local knowledge of Indigenous people could be harnessed more effectively through an ongoing relationship with such organisations, to better address the complex contingencies confronting the census process in remote Indigenous Australia.","2007","http://books.google.es/books?id=Ydj3AQAAQBAJ&pg=PA71&dq=contingency+%2B+systemic&hl=&cd=19&source=gbs_api","9781921313585",
"Law and Reflexive Politics","contingency + systemic","[E.A. Christodoulidis]","[Law]","Law and Reflexive Politics argues against the dominant recent `republican' trend in legal and democratic theory that sees law as the prime vessel of political action, means of empowerment of civil society and guarantor of democratic politics. Against theorists as diverse as Dworkin, Habermas, Unger, Ackerman and others it argues that the law cannot, as these theorists would have it, contain the politics of civil society and exhaust what these politics are about. The first part of the book explores the recent trends in legal and political theory that suggest the internal linking of democracy and law. The second part is a critique of these positions through an application of systems theory, but one that offers an internal critique of systems theory itself as well as a study of the inter-relationships between law, politics and conflict. The final part advances a suggestion for a definition, or re-conceptualisation, of the political as `reflexive', that will re-politicise law's rendering of conflict, political action and identity. What is `stilled' by the law here becomes contested terrain again and, as such, political.","2001-11-30","http://books.google.es/books?id=RYFMzAPYYOYC&pg=PA111&dq=contingency+%2B+systemic&hl=&cd=20&source=gbs_api","1402002831",

The FBAs identified academic escape, peer attention, and teacher attention to varying degrees for each student as the environmental variables interacting with the students' likelihood of demonstrating a wide range of off-task behaviors. An intervention incorporating social skills training, a randomized contingency for reinforcement which included random criteria and random reward selection, and self-assessment was sufficient to reduce the maladaptive behavior frequency. A nonconcurrent multiple baseline across students suggests that the decrease in off-task frequency is attributed to the intervention. Although baseline measurements were obtained for all three students, only two received the intervention while the third remained in baseline throughout the study.","2007","http://books.google.es/books?id=iuFOCuMTAUcC&pg=PA37&dq=contingency+%2B+systemic&hl=&cd=26&source=gbs_api","0549219382",

The study argues that despite media, public, and even official analyses about its material resources and leadership deficiencies, these are not enough to explain FEMA's response. As an alternative, it is suggested that an exploration of the context Katrina generated and the affect of the agency's organizational design given that context, will provide additional insights. In order to develop appropriate hypotheses, a new conceptual approach to ""extreme occasions"" is presented along with a number of types, including disasters and catastrophes. A triangulated single case study methodology is used to test the difference between disasters and catastrophes and explore the affect of this context given FEMA's organizational design. Results support the hypothesized empirical difference between disasters and catastrophes. Results regarding the affect of organic design on effectiveness are mixed, but tend to favor the hypothesized relationships. Conclusions discuss the importance of this study for theory and practice and also address ways to further develop this analytic approach.","2008","http://books.google.es/books?id=w1p1lUhWUAcC&pg=PA26&dq=contingency+%2B+systemic&hl=&cd=31&source=gbs_api","0549926739",
"Beyond the Market. The Social Foundations of Economic Efficiency","contingency + systemic","[Jens Beckert]","[Social Science]","Beyond the Market launches a sociological investigation into economic efficiency. Prevailing economic theory, which explains efficiency using formalized rational choice models, often simplifies human behavior to the point of distortion. Jens Beckert finds such theory to be particularly weak in explaining such crucial forms of economic behavior as cooperation, innovation, and action under conditions of uncertainty--phenomena he identifies as the proper starting point for a sociology of economic action. Beckert levels an enlightened critique at neoclassical economics, arguing that understanding efficiency requires looking well beyond the market to the social, cultural, political, and cognitive factors that influence the coordination of economic action. Beckert searches social theory for the components of an alternative theory of action, one that accounts for the social embedding of economic behavior. In Durkheim and Parsons he finds especially useful approaches to cooperation; in Luhmann, a way to understand how people act under highly contingent conditions; and in Giddens, an understanding of creative action and innovation. Together, these provide building blocks for a research program that will yield a theoretically sophisticated understanding of how economic processes are coordinated and the ways that markets are embedded in social, cultural, and cognitive structures. Containing one of the most fully informed critiques of the neoclassical analysis of economic efficiency--as well as one of the most thoughtful blueprints for economic sociology--this book reclaims for sociology the study of one of the most important arenas of human action.","2009-01-10","http://books.google.es/books?id=JrSOPGIAgdcC&pg=PA207&dq=contingency+%2B+systemic&hl=&cd=32&source=gbs_api","140082544X",

"Naming and Thinking God in Europe Today. Theology in Global Dialogue","contingency + systemic","[Norbert Hintersteiner]","[Religion]","Is there a new need and place for God-talk in Europe? The volume at hand confirms this as much as it opens up further questions. It shows, in Europe, different traditions of naming and thinking God draw on varying theoretical and philosophical foundations that in many ways compete with one another. Due to socio-cultural and political divides, along with the complex histories and intellectual rivalries between Eastern and Western Europe, these theological traditions often suffer from isolation and from mutual misunderstanding. Can these tensions be better addressed and can these conflicts be better understood? While exploring a variety of approaches in Europe on the topic, several authors also ask: How can God be named and thought in Europe as it finds itself in midst of complex crosscultural and interreligious processes? Particularly as immigration increases and peoples of non-Christian faith traditions name and think God in ways that differ from and sometimes conflict with Europe's dominant religion(s) and secular culture. What function and impact will traditional God-talk have in a globalizing Europe as religions such as Islam, Hinduism, and Buddhism come into the Western foreground? The volume at hand not only reveals the broad spectrum of its topic, but it also documents the vivid seeking undertaken by a new generation of European theologians and scholars of religion who openly engage the question of how to live and believe in Europe today in the face of increasingly complex global relations and challenges.","2007","http://books.google.es/books?id=2Cqv3YDE5uoC&pg=PA33&dq=contingency+%2B+systemic&hl=&cd=35&source=gbs_api","9789042022058",

The recent development in organization design has been sporadic; hence, this book will be an important step in creating more thoughtful research and stronger empirical analyses that take advantage of advances in estimation methods allowing for more complex causal modeling and stimulation technologies. Featured in the book are the more practical elements of implementing OD in organizations. The chapter material is organized into five sections: (1) Putting Contingency Theory in its Place, (2) Focus on Individuals who make up the Organization, (3) Innovation Processes and Organization Design, (4) Adaptation and Technology, and (5) Design for Performance. The book will be a broad discussion of topics in the field, but still each individual chapter will provide in-depth analysis of the topic.","2008-06-25","http://books.google.es/books?id=mX4Zh77vG3UC&pg=PA34&dq=contingency+%2B+structure&hl=&cd=5&source=gbs_api","9780387777764",

"Structure and contingency. evolutionary processes in life and human society","contingency + structure","[John L.

In particular, it focuses on the interplay between form and structure: the things that we might predict and model and the things we cannot predict -- the arbitrary and the contingent -- which may be as important, or even more important, than the way in which life on earth has evolved. The contributors are drawn from palaeontology, archaeology, anthropology and human evolution; the timescales covered are from the development of life on earth, through human evolution to later prehistory and historic archaeology. Underpinning the theme of the book is the work of Stephen Jay Gould, who has developed a distinctive philosophy of history concerning the nature of long-term and short-term evolutionary processes, particularly stressing the interplay between structure and contingency.","1999","http://books.google.es/books?id=VpkjAQAAIAAJ&q=contingency+%2B+structure&dq=contingency+%2B+structure&hl=&cd=8&source=gbs_api","STANFORD:36105024330321",

"Collaborative Communities of Firms. Purpose, Process, and Design","contingency + structure","[Anne Bøllingtoft, Lex Donaldson, George P. Huber, Dorthe Døjbak Håkonsson, Charles C. Snow]","[Business enterprises]","Faced with the ever-accelerating pace of technological change and the restructuring of markets, many firms have been questioning the appropriateness of their own organizational structure and effectiveness. Consequently, we have witnessed much organizational experimentation and the development of new forms of organizing over the last decade. Firms are more dependent than ever on the need for continuous and radical innovations and often innovations that go beyond their existing businesses. This challenges firms in terms of knowledge and idea sharing, and often necessitates the need to expand beyond the boundaries of the single firm for multi-party collaboration to meet serious challenges and develop creative solutions. Drawing from the Fourth International Workshop on Organization Design, and featuring contributions from an international array of specialists, this volume focuses on the expansion beyond the boundaries of the single firm and multi-firm networks, to include, for example, community-based organization designs. A community is a connected set of firms; the connections can take on many different dimensions. For organization design theory, community-based organizations have many implications. For one, organization design theory has to identify and describe designs that enhance collaborative behavior among firms without restricting the ability of the individual firm to continue to compete within its own marketplace. Moreover, organization design theory also has to identify and describe information processing strategies and designs that allow the continuous generation, sharing, and application of existing information and knowledge. The development of effective collaborative community designs is critically important to the global economy because, increasingly, our future depends on pursuing shared goals and sustainably developing our global commons. Ideally, theideas and findings in this book will contribute to increased attention to new organization designs capable of meeting 21st-century opportunities and challenges.","2011-11-23","http://books.google.es/books?id=0p2usNwqd5cC&pg=PA48&dq=contingency+%2B+structure&hl=&cd=30&source=gbs_api","1461412846",

"Functional Analytic Psychotherapy. Creating Intense and Curative Therapeutic Relationships","contingency + structures","[Robert J. Kohlenberg, Mavis Tsai]","[Medical]","As cognitive behavior therapy becomes increasingly integrated, Functional Analytic Psychotherapy (FAP) remains a rich therapeutic method. FAP synthesizes aspects of psychodynamic and object relations therapy with traditional CBT methods, and author/ practitioners Robert Kohlenberg and Mavis Tsai originally created this book to be more than a simple how-to manual. Rather it is a powerful framework for clinicians seeking to rethink their approach to the therapeutic relationship. Now in paperback, this classic work is more relevant than ever. The book begins with the theory behind the therapy (including its roots in B. F. Skinner’s behavior-analytic work in the 1970s), explaining why clients’ unique needs may extend beyond well-mapped routes to change. From there, the authors present the clinical principles of FAP and their uses in treating diffuse, resistant problems. Case illustrations model the therapeutic dyad, show FAP techniques in action, and offer crucial caveats. The ground rules: how, and why, FAP works. Recognizing clinically relevant verbal behaviors. The role of the self in personality disorders. New roles for cognitions and beliefs in therapy. Memories and emotions: what they can and can’t do to promote change. How FAP fills the niche between psychodynamic and behavioral therapy. Key issues in ethics, research, and supervision. For the clinical psychologist interested in revitalizing practice, minimizing impasses, and treating clients on a deeper emotional level, Functional Analytic Psychotherapy brings fresh insights to the many worlds within and outside the clinical setting. Graduate students, especially, will find this text a valuable window onto traditional behavioral approaches to therapy.","2007-06-26","http://books.google.es/books?id=0GCGG03slAoC&pg=PA113&dq=contingency+%2B+structures&hl=&cd=11&source=gbs_api","0387708545",
"Dynamic Capabilities. How Organisational Structures Affect Knowledge Processes","contingency + structures","[Philip Cordes-Berszinn]","[Business & Economics]","The concept of dynamic capabilities, especially in terms of organizational knowledge processes, has become the predominant paradigm for the explanation of competitive advantages. However, major unsolved - or at least insufficiently solved - problems are first their measurement and second their management by concrete managerial options, such as design options of organizational structures. Dynamic Capabilities provides an integrated descriptive model of both dynamic capabilities and organizational structures that allows characterizing, classifying and a comparison. It develops a logic system of a multitude of combinatorial possibilities between their variables, and it develops a complex and integrated system of associated empirically based and qualitatively deduced hypotheses. Therewith, it serves as a terminological and analytical foundation for the identification of knowledge-based dynamic capabilities in organizations and for a targeted design of organizational structures that enable and foster dynamic capability processes such as knowledge transfer and knowledge absorption.","2013-11-29","http://books.google.es/books?id=7kSvAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA118&dq=contingency+%2B+structures&hl=&cd=13&source=gbs_api","9781137351289",

"European Socialists Respond to Fascism: Ideology, Activism and Contingency in the 1930s","contingency + structures","[Gerd-Rainer Horn Assistant Professor of History Western Oregon State College]","[History]","Based on documents collected in six European countries, European Socialists Respond to Fascism: Ideology, Activism and Contingency in the 1930s is a transnational study of largely parallel developments in Austria, Belgium, France, Germany, and Spain in the years 1933-1936. Triggered into action by the shock effect of the Nazi rise to power in Germany, socialists throughout Western Europe entered an unusually active period of practical reorientation and debate over political strategy which helped determine the contours of European politics up to the outbreak of World War II and beyond. Stressing the transnational dimension of this process while simultaneously integrating local, regional, and national factors, this work finds that it was social democracy, rather than communism, that acted as the primary vehicle for radical change among European marxists during the 1930s. Following major figures within the European left and the significant events that made up the inter-war period, Gerd-Rainer Horn demonstrates the interconnectedness of Europe's interwar socialists. Finally, Horn manages to relate these findings to the ongoing interdisciplinary debate on structure, agency, and contingency in the historical process.","1996-10-24","http://books.google.es/books?id=sHj_2LoSmvkC&pg=PA164&dq=contingency+%2B+structures&hl=&cd=25&source=gbs_api","9780195357554",

One crucial strategy for governments in orchestrating the transformation to cleaner economies is to enable low-carbon investment. The author therefore takes a critical look at how climate governance is reframed as an economic and investment challenge in recent years, and reveals some of the blind spots of focusing on the economic and investment opportunities related to climate protection.","2013-05-23","http://books.google.es/books?id=2WpEAAAAQBAJ&pg=PA64&dq=contingency+%2B+structures&hl=&cd=26&source=gbs_api","9783658024062",

What if he creates the virus with intentions of making a cure, only to have it stolen before he can finish his work? Enter an agent working for a secret government agency whose mission is to protect U.S. interests. But when terrorists threaten his family, will revenge cause him to stray from his primary mission? Will the fate of the U.S. lie in the hands of a network of Zombie Apocalypse preparedness groups whose loyalties are not always clear? Gary Ecks, a world-renowned scientist with an uncanny knack for predicting outbreaks of viral hemorrhagic fevers has a terrifying realization that one of these viruses will soon mutate into something that seemingly kills its victims, but actually brings them to a near death state, allowing them to move about and further spread the virus. He foresaw the arrival of a virus that could start the zombie apocalypse. In an attempt to prevent the start of a zombie apocalypse, Gary believes he needs to create a vaccine before the virus naturally appears, so he needs the help of a colleague at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta, Natalie Wyler, to help create the very virus he predicted. She had pioneered a method to create viruses with specific genetic sequences. Something convinces Natalie to help him in spite of every fiber in her being screaming out against it, but the two scientists are prevented from starting work on the vaccine. Little do they know that their activity at the CDC has also been flagged by a secretive shadow government organization. But what is their true agenda? Will they help stop a zombie virus outbreak, or act on a hidden agenda? Further complications arise as the lab goes on furlough, separating Gary and Natalie while they each return to their hometowns, leaving the lab and the virus samples unattended. A series of events leads Gary on a mission to find Natalie, and the goal to develop a vaccine becomes one to hunt for a cure.","2014-01-31","http://books.google.es/books?id=CizZAgAAQBAJ&pg=PT140&dq=contingency+%2B+network&hl=&cd=9&source=gbs_api","9781311075536",

"Buffering Techniques for Delivery of Compressed Video in Video-on-Demand Systems","contingency + network","[Wu-chi Feng]","[Computers]","Many emerging technologies such as video conferencing, video-on-demand, and digital libraries require the efficient delivery of compressed video streams. For applications that require the delivery of compressed stored multimedia streams, the a priori knowledge available about these compressed streams can aid in the allocation of server and network resources. By using a client-side buffer, the resource requirements from the server and network can be minimized. Buffering Techniques for Delivery of Compressed Video in Video-on-Demand Systems presents a comprehensive description of buffering techniques for the delivery of compressed, prerecorded multimedia data. While these techniques can be applied to any compressed data streams, this book focusses primarily on the delivery of video streams because of the large resource requirements that they can consume. The book first describes buffering techniques for the continuous playback of stored video sources. In particular, several bandwidth smoothing (or buffering) algorithms that are provably optimal under certain conditions are presented. To provide a well-rounded discussion, the book then describes extensions that aid in the ability to provide interactive delivery of video across networks. Specifically, reservation techniques that take into account interactive functions such as fast-forward and rewind are described. In addition, extensions to the bandwidth smoothing algorithms presented in the first few chapters are described. These algorithms are designed with interactive, continuous playback of stored video in mind and are also provably optimal under certain constraints.Buffering Techniques for Delivery of Compressed Video inVideo-on-Demand Systems serves as an excellent resource for multimedia systems, networking and video-on-demand designers, and may be used as a text for advanced courses on the topic.","1997-01-01","http://books.google.es/books?id=Ki-QAVQbqxEC&pg=PA94&dq=contingency+%2B+network&hl=&cd=13&source=gbs_api","9780585314037",

"Theories of the Multinational Firm. A Multidimensional Creature in the Global Economy","contingency + network","[M. Forsgren]","[Business & Economics]","This book is all about understanding multinational companies (MNCs) why they exist, how they compete, and their impact on society. Six important theoretical perspectives of the MNC are discussed at length and compared. The book can be read and understood at multiple levels, from learning what each theory is about to appreciating the more subtle implications of their differences for firms and society. Despite the complexity of the subject, the book is an easy and enjoyable read. It is written in a lively, user-friendly style, with many illustrated examples. William G. Egelhoff, Fordham University, US In most accounts, especially in the journal literature, the theory of international business is seen as evolving steadily through the incremental addition of a series of largely complementary analytical building blocks. Mats Forsgren sees instead a set of conflicting perspectives on the subject. In this valuable contribution he breaks down theoretical complexity in this field into its distinctive parts. He thereby gives us a better understanding of how these parts relate to one another or don t. John Cantwell, Rutgers University, US This excellent book deals with six theoretical approaches to the multinational firm, its activities and organization. The theories and their implications are explained and contrasted with each other. The clear and concise treatment of theories makes the work very useful for students, while its critical and comparative analysis can be a source of ideas for further developments by researchers. I highly recommend the book for students, teachers and researchers. Grazia Ietto-Gillies, London South Bank University, UK This timely textbook presents the assumptions and theories behind contemporary views on the multinational firm as an organization and as an actor in the global economy. Mats Forsgren analyzes and compares six different theories of the multinational firm from the dominating multinational to the politicizing multinational that have dominated the research in international business during the last four decades. Mats Forsgren reveals the basic building blocks and assumptions behind each theory in order to reach a better understanding of why the multinational firm is looked upon in so many different ways by researchers and stakeholders. This important textbook will be an invaluable resource for both undergraduate and postgraduate students on international business, international management and international economy courses.","2008","http://books.google.es/books?id=o8yYaTMV8RkC&pg=PA96&dq=contingency+%2B+network&hl=&cd=29&source=gbs_api","9781848443891",

The existing field has its origin in the functioning of the human brain in processing information, recognizing pattern, learning from observations and experiments, storing and retrieving information from memory, etc. In particular, the power industry being on the verge of epoch changing due to deregulation, the power engineers require Computational intelligence tools for proper planning, operation and control of the power system. Most of the CI tools are suitably formulated as some sort of optimization or decision making problems. These CI techniques provide the power utilities with innovative solutions for efficient analysis, optimal operation and control and intelligent decision making. This edited volume deals with different CI techniques for solving real world Power Industry problems.

"Embedding the Postauricular Reflex in a Psychophysiological Nomological Network of Emotion: Modulation by Pictures, Sounds, and Dysphoria","contingency + network","[Stephen Douglas Benning]",,"The postauricular (PA) reflex is a microreflex behind the ear that is elicited by repetitive acoustic stimulation. Its magnitude is larger during pleasant pictures and smaller during aversive pictures compared to PA reflexes during neutral pictures. In this dissertation, the anatomical specificity of this seemingly appetitive pattern of modulation was investigated by measuring reflexes from the superior auricular (SA) and anterior auricular (AA) muscles. Additionally, startle blink reflexes were recorded alongside PA, SA, and AA reflexes during pictures and sounds, as were corrugator and zygomatic electromyograms (EMGs). To investigate the impact of hedonic capacity on PA reflex modulation, individuals high in dysphoria (defined as high self-reported depressive symptoms and low trait positive emotionality) and low in dysphoria (defined as low self-reported depressive symptoms and high trait positive emotionality) were selected to participate in this study. The only auricular reflex that demonstrated an appetitive pattern of modulation was the PA reflex; PA reflexes were also greater than SA and AA reflexes, and SA reflexes were greater than AA reflexes. The magnitude of the PA reflex was greater during pleasant than during neutral pictures and sounds. However, its magnitude was greater during aversive sounds than during neutral sounds, whereas this pattern was not evident during aversive versus neutral pictures. Though dysphoria did not influence the basic appetitive pattern of PA reflex modulation, only those high in dysphoria showed significant attentional diminution of PA reflex magnitudes during pictures compared to those during inter-trial intervals. Participants who were low in dysphoria showed an inhibition of startle blink reflexes during aversive pictures compared to those during neutral pictures (but not during aversive versus neutral sounds). Those high in dysphoria failed to potentiate corrugator EMG activity during aversive pictures, and they also showed overall reduced zygomatic EMG activity during pictures compared to those low in dysphoria. During pictures, the modulations of all psychophysiological measures besides eorrugator EMGs followed a bipolar valence pattern most closely; corrugator EMG modulation tended to correspond to a dimension of negative affect.","2006","http://books.google.es/books?id=qhEneEeUibIC&pg=PA5&dq=contingency+%2B+network&hl=&cd=33&source=gbs_api","054283443X",
"Technocapitalism. A Critical Perspective on Technological Innovation and Corporatism","contingency + network","[Luis Suarez-Villa]","[Business & Economics]","A new version of capitalism, grounded in technology and science, is spawning new forms of corporate power and organization that will have major implications for the twenty-first century. Technological creativity is thereby turned into a commodity in new corporate regimes that are primarily oriented toward research and intellectual appropriation. This phenomenon is likely to have major social, economic, and political consequences, as the new corporatism becomes ever more intrusive and rapacious through its control over technology and innovation. In his provocative book Technocapitalism, Luis Suarez-Villa addresses this phenomenon from the perspective of radical political economy and social criticism. Grounded in the premise that relations of power influence how human creativity and technology are exploited by the new corporatism, the author argues that new forms of democratic participation and resistance are needed, if the social pathologies created by this new version of capitalism are to be checked. Considering the new sectors affected by technocapitalism, such as biotechnology, nanotechnology, bioinformatics, and genomics, Suarez-Villa deciphers the common threads of power and organization that drive their corporatization. These new sectors, and the corporate apparatus set up to extract profit and power through them, are imposing standards, creating business models, molding social governance, and influencing social relations at all levels. The new reality they create is likely to affect most every aspect of human existence, including work, health, life, and nature itself.","2012-08-03","http://books.google.es/books?id=RjJUmthF7zIC&pg=PA95&dq=contingency+%2B+network&hl=&cd=34&source=gbs_api","9781439900437",

"Recovering Informal Learning. Wisdom, Judgement and Community","contingency + network","[Paul J. Hager, John Halliday]","[Education]","For too long, theories and practices of learning have been dominated by the requirements of formal learning. Quite simply this book seeks to persuade readers through philosophical argument and empirically grounded examples that the balance should be shifted back towards the informal. These arguments and examples are taken from informal learning in very diverse situations, such as in leisure activities, as a preparation for and as part of work, and as a means of surviving undesirable circumstances like dead-end jobs and incarceration. Informal learning can be fruitfully thought of as developing the capacity to make context sensitive judgments during ongoing practical involvements of a variety of kinds. Such involvements are necessarily indeterminate and opportunistic. Hence there is a major challenge to policy makers in shifting the balance towards informal learning without destroying the very things that are desirable about informal learning and indeed learning in general. The book has implications therefore for formal learning too and the way that teaching might proceed within formally constituted educational institutions such as schools and colleges.","2007-05-23","http://books.google.es/books?id=XI1LuUsaC_gC&pg=PA103&dq=contingency+%2B+network&hl=&cd=40&source=gbs_api","9781402053467",

"Spectral Clustering and Biclustering.

Classical and modern statistical methods applicable to biological, social, communication networks, or microarrays are presented together with the theoretical background and proofs. This book is suitable for a one-semester course for graduate students in data mining, multivariate statistics, or applied graph theory; but by skipping the proofs, the algorithms can also be used by specialists who just want to retrieve information from their data when analysing communication, social, or biological networks. Spectral Clustering and Biclustering: Provides a unified treatment for edge-weighted graphs and contingency tables via methods of multivariate statistical analysis (factoring, clustering, and biclustering). Uses spectral embedding and relaxation to estimate multiway cuts of edge-weighted graphs and bicuts of contingency tables. Goes beyond the expanders by describing the structure of dense graphs with a small spectral gap via the structural eigenvalues and eigen-subspaces of the normalized modularity matrix. Treats graphs like statistical data by combining methods of graph theory and statistics. Establishes a common outline structure for the contents of each algorithm, applicable to networks and microarrays, with unified notions and principles.","2013-06-19","http://books.google.es/books?id=RcIzsThrbCIC&printsec=frontcover&dq=contingency+%2B+networks&hl=&cd=17&source=gbs_api","9781118650707",

"Strategic Information Security","contingency + networks","[John Wylder]","[Computers]","The new emphasis on physical security resulting from the terrorist threat has forced many information security professionals to struggle to maintain their organization's focus on protecting information assets. In order to command attention, they need to emphasize the broader role of information security in the strategy of their companies. Until now, however, most books about strategy and planning have focused on the production side of the business, rather than operations. Strategic Information Security integrates the importance of sound security policy with the strategic goals of an organization. It provides IT professionals and management with insight into the issues surrounding the goals of protecting valuable information assets. This text reiterates that an effective information security program relies on more than policies or hardware and software, instead it hinges on having a mindset that security is a core part of the business and not just an afterthought. Armed with the content contained in this book, security specialists can redirect the discussion of security towards the terms and concepts that management understands. This increases the likelihood of obtaining the funding and managerial support that is needed to build and maintain airtight security programs.","2003-11-24","http://books.google.es/books?id=gPWoe-8MGZkC&pg=PA72&dq=contingency+%2B+networks&hl=&cd=27&source=gbs_api","9780203497081",
"Sectoral Systems of Innovation and Production in Developing Countries. Actors, Structure and Evolution","contingency + networks","[Franco Malerba, Sunil Mani]","[Social Science]","Over the past decade there has been a dramatic increase in the quantity and quality of research focused on the processes through which technological capabilities are acquired by countries significantly behind the economic frontier, and the institutions that effectively support the catching up process. This book is a splendid contribution to this literature. The concept of a sectoral innovation system is well suited for framing studies of these kinds of questions, and serves well to unify the many interesting empirical studies in the book. Some of those studies are success stories, others of less successful cases. Readers new to this body of research will find this book a great introduction. All readers will learn a lot from it about what is required for and involved in economic development. Richard R. Nelson, Columbia Earth Institute, US and University of Manchester, UK This book examines in detail the features and dynamics of sectoral systems of innovation and production in developing countries. Processes of rapid growth are usually associated with specific sectors such as automobiles, electronics or software, as well as with the transformation of traditional sectors such as agriculture and food. The book shows, however, that the variations across all these sectors in terms of structure and dynamics is so great that a full understanding of these differences is necessary if innovation is to be encouraged and growth sustained. The expert contributors promote this understanding by drawing upon empirical evidence from a wide range of sectoral systems, from traditional to high technology, and across a number of countries. They explore how these systems change and evolve, highlighting policy lessons to be drawn from the analysis. Case studies include the Brazilian aeronautical, pulp and paper industries, the Korean machine tool sector, motorbike manufacture in Thailand and Vietnam, pharmaceuticals and telecommunication equipment in India, ICT in Taiwan, the biofuels sector in Tanzania, salmon farming in Chile and software in Uruguay. Scholars and researchers in the fields of economics development economics in particular and innovation will find this book to be of great interest. Policymakers and managers focussing on innovation and growth in developing countries will also warmly welcome the book.","2009-01-01","http://books.google.es/books?id=Npd4asc3huoC&pg=PA57&dq=contingency+%2B+networks&hl=&cd=28&source=gbs_api","9781849802185",

"Economics of Standards in Information Networks. With 70 Tables","contingency + networks","[Tim Weitzel]","[Business & Economics]","Standards play a prominent role in systems characterized by interaction. In information systems, standards provide for compatibility and are a prerequisite for collaboration benefits. More generally speaking, standards constitute networks. In this work, a standardization framework based on an analysis of deficiencies of network effect theory and a game theoretic network equilibrium analysis is developed. Fundamental determinants of diffusion processes in networks (e.g. network topology, agent size, installed base) are identified and incorporated into a computer-based simulation model. As a result, typical network behaviour (specific diffusion patterns) can be explained and many findings from traditional network effect theory can be described as special cases of the model at particular parameter constellations (e.g. low price, high density). On this basis, solution strategies for standardization problems are developed, and a methodological path towards a unified theory of networks is proposed.

"Agency, Contingency and Census Process. Observations of the 2006 Indigenous Enumeration Strategy in Remote Aboriginal Australia","contingency + networks","[Frances Morphy]","[Social Science]","The Indigenous Enumeration Strategy (IES) of the Australian National Census of Population and Housing has evolved over the years in response to the perceived 'difference' of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander populations. Its defining characteristics are the use of locally recruited, mostly Indigenous collector interviewers, and the administration of a modified collection instrument in discrete Indigenous communities, mostly in remote Australia. The research reported here is unique. The authors, with the assistance of the Australian Bureau of Statistics, were able to follow the workings of the IES in the 2006 Census from the design of the collection instrument to the training of temporary census field staff at the Northern Territory's Census Management Unit in Darwin, to the enumeration in four remote locations, through to the processing stage at the Data Processing Centre in Melbourne. This allowed the tracking of data from collection to processing, and an assessment of the effects of information flows on the quality of the data, both as input and output. This study of the enumeration involved four very different locations: a group of small outstation communities (Arnhem Land), a large Aboriginal township (Wadeye), an 'open' town with a majority Aboriginal population (Fitzroy Crossing), and the minority Aboriginal population of a major regional centre (Alice Springs). A comparison between these contexts reveals differences that reflect the diversity of remote Aboriginal Australia, but also commonalities that exert a powerful influence on the effectiveness of the IES, in particular very high levels of short-term mobility. The selection of sites also allowed a comparison between the enumeration process in the Northern Territory, where a time-extended rolling count was explicitly planned for, and Western Australia, where a modified form of the standard count had been envisaged. The findings suggest that the IES has reached a point in its development where the injection of ever-increasing resources into essentially the same generic set and structure of activities may be producing diminishing returns. There is a need for a new kind of engagement between the Australian Bureau of Statistics and local government and Indigenous community-sector organisations in remote Australia. The agency and local knowledge of Indigenous people could be harnessed more effectively through an ongoing relationship with such organisations, to better address the complex contingencies confronting the census process in remote Indigenous Australia.","2007","http://books.google.es/books?id=dYq19CY7Sb4C&pg=PA9&dq=contingency+%2B+networks&hl=&cd=39&source=gbs_api","1921313595",

It describes the current state of planning and thinking within the Australian Defence Force with respect to Network Centric Warfare, and discusses the vulnerabilities that accompany the use by Defence of the National Information Infrastructure (NII), as well as Defence's responsibility for the protection of the NII. It notes the multitude of agencies concerned in various ways with information security, and argues that mechanisms are required to enhance coordination between them. It also argues that Australia has been laggard with respect to the development of offensive cyber-warfare plans and capabilities. Finally, it proposes the establishment of an Australian Cyber-warfare Centre responsible for the planning and conduct of both the defensive and offensive dimensions of cyber-warfare, for developing doctrine and operational concepts, and for identifying new capability requirements. It argues that the matter is urgent in order to ensure that Australia will have the necessary capabilities for conducting technically and strategically sophisticated cyber-warfare activities by the 2020s. The Foreword has been contributed by Professor Kim C. Beazley, former Minister for Defence (1984--90), who describes it as 'a timely book which transcends old debates on priorities for the defence of Australia or forward commitments, (and) debates about globalism and regionalism', and as 'an invaluable compendium' to the current process of refining the strategic guidance for Australia's future defence policies and capabilities.","2008-07","http://books.google.es/books?id=bbyn_o4EP-YC&pg=PA9&dq=contingency+%2B+networked&hl=&cd=19&source=gbs_api","9781921313806",
"Networks of Influence? : Developing Countries in a Networked Global Order. Developing Countries in a Networked Global Order","contingency + networked","[Ngaire Woods, Leonardo Martinez-Diaz]","[Business & Economics]","Networks are thriving in global politics. Some bring policy-makers from different countries together to share problems and to forge possible solutions, free from rules of representation, decision-making, and transparency which constrain more formal international organizations. This book asks whether developing countries can benefit from such networks? Or are they safer to conduct their international relations in formal institutions? The answer varies. The key lies in how the network is structured and what it sets out to achieve. This book presents a fascinating account of how some networks have strengthened the position of developing country officials, both at home, and in their international negotiations. Equally, it points to conditions which make it perilous for developing countries to rely on networks.","2009-05-14","http://books.google.es/books?id=PGxI_R9jA5YC&pg=PA67&dq=contingency+%2B+networked&hl=&cd=22&source=gbs_api","9780191569838",
"State Interventions and Hospital Response in Community Health Promotion: A Comparative Study of California, Texas and Florida","contingency + networked","[Wendy L. Chen]",,"The growth of under and uninsured populations and the corporatization of health care have raised concerns about whether not-for-profit hospitals are fulfilling their community-oriented mission. Starting in the early 1990, state governments began instituting laws to regulate not-for-profit hospitals' provision of community benefit services in exchange for their tax exemption status and subsequent advantages. This study employs a pre-post quasi-experimental design to investigate the effectiveness of community benefit laws, factors influencing not-for-profit hospitals' abilities to comply with these laws and the potential spill-over effects on for-profit hospitals' community benefit behaviors between 1991 and 2002. Results of the study suggest that the process-oriented California community benefit law was not effective in promoting not-for-profit hospitals' community benefit activities. The prescriptive approach to state community benefit law, as seen in Texas, significantly bolstered not-for-profit hospitals' provision of charity care. Hospital size positively facilitates not-for-profit hospitals' response to the laws. The effects of other contingency factors are inconsistent across states. Finally, the spill-over effects of state community benefit laws cannot be characterized uniformly across states. For-profit hospitals' reactions to increased not-for-profit contribution to community benefit activities vary by state and by policy design.","2007","http://books.google.es/books?id=-i4s3WK-mE8C&pg=PA111&dq=contingency+%2B+networked&hl=&cd=23&source=gbs_api","054932187X",
"Relational, Networked and Collaborative Approaches to Public Diplomacy. The Connective Mindshift","contingency + networked","[R.S. Zaharna, Amelia Arsenault, Ali Fisher]","[Political Science]","Over the past decade, scholars, practitioners, and leading diplomats have forcefully argued for the need to move beyond one-way, mass-media-driven campaigns and develop more relational strategies. In the coming years, as the range of public diplomacy actors grows, the issues become more complexly intertwined, and the use of social media proliferates, the focus on relations will intensify along with the demands for more sophisticated strategies. These changes in the international arena call for a connective mindshift: a shift from information control and dominance to skilled relationship management. Leading international scholars and practitioners embark on a forward-looking exploration of creative conceptual frameworks, training methods, and case studies that advance relational, networking, and collaborative strategies in public diplomacy. Light on academic jargon and rich in analysis, this volume argues that while relationships have always been pivotal to the practice of public diplomacy, the relational dynamics are changing. Rather than focus on specific definitions, the contributors focus on the dynamic interplay of influence in the public diplomacy environment. That environment includes state and non-state actors, public and private partners, competitors and collaborators, new and old media, and is conditioned by power, ethics, and cultures. This book is an essential resource to students and practitioners interested on how to build relationships and transform them into more elaborate network structures through public communication. It will challenge you to push the boundaries of what you think are the mechanisms, benefits, and potential issues raised by a relational approach to public diplomacy","2014-02-05","http://books.google.es/books?id=I3DMAgAAQBAJ&pg=PT279&dq=contingency+%2B+networked&hl=&cd=26&source=gbs_api","9781136179204",

"Advances in Networked Enterprises. Virtual Organisations, Balanced Automation, and Systems Integration","contingency + networked","[Luis M. Camarinha-Matos, Hamideh Afsarmanesh, Heinz-H. Erbe]","[Business & Economics]","New market trends and the emergence of the so-called Internet-based `new economy' are leading companies to new forms of organization, mostly relying on privileged cooperation links. Nowadays, most manufacturing processes are not carried out by single enterprises. Rather, organizations feel the need to focus on their core competencies and join efforts with others, in order to fulfill the requirements of new products/services demanded by the global market. In a cooperative networked organization, every enterprise is just a node that adds some value to the process; namely, a step in the manufacturing/supply chain. Furthermore, manufacturing companies increasingly encompass what has typically been regarded as the domain of the service sector. They try to establish long-term relationships with their customers, in order to service their needs around a manufactured product. For these reasons, the area of virtual organizations and industrial virtual enterprises is attracting growing interest in terms of research and development, and implementation approaches for new business practices. The main emphasis of this book is on virtual enterprises and other networked organizations, with special focus on: supporting infrastructures and management of distributed business processes, intelligent multi-agent systems, knowledge management, human interfaces, and socio-economical aspects. Also included in the book are related topics on automation, both in manufacturing and transportation. Special attention is assigned to the fact that advances in information technology and new organizational paradigms will be used not only to induce new economic structures, but also to help a sustainable migration of existing systems towards the new economy. When electronic business initiatives attract such widespread attention, it is important to conciliate the `old' and `new' economies under a balanced perspective. Advances in Networked Enterprises is essential reading for researchers and engineering students in production engineering, computer science, electrical engineering, mechanical engineering, industrial sociology, and transportation, as well as for engineers and practitioners in manufacturing and transportation systems organization and planning.","2000-09-30","http://books.google.es/books?id=iAUzEdcCcVcC&pg=PA10&dq=contingency+%2B+networked&hl=&cd=28&source=gbs_api","0792379586",

Drawing on interviews with more than sixty political staffers, fieldwork during the 2008 primaries and general election, and archival research, Daniel Kreiss shows how a group of young, technically-skilled Internet staffers came together on the Howard Dean campaign and created a series of innovations in organization, tools, and practice that have changed the elections game. He charts how these individuals carried their innovations across Democratic politics, contributing to a number of electoral victories, including Barack Obama's historic bid for the presidency. In revealing this history, the book provides a rich empirical look at the communication tools, practices, and infrastructure that shape contemporary online campaigning.

"Intelligent Diagnosis and Prognosis of Industrial Networked Systems","contingency + networked","[Chee Khiang Pang, Frank L. Lewis, Tong Heng Lee, Zhao Yang Dong]","[Computers]","In an era of intense competition where plant operating efficiencies must be maximized, downtime due to machinery failure has become more costly. To cut operating costs and increase revenues, industries have an urgent need to predict fault progression and remaining lifespan of industrial machines, processes, and systems. An engineer who mounts an acoustic sensor onto a spindle motor wants to know when the ball bearings will wear out without having to halt the ongoing milling processes. A scientist working on sensor networks wants to know which sensors are redundant and can be pruned off to save operational and computational overheads. These scenarios illustrate a need for new and unified perspectives in system analysis and design for engineering applications. Intelligent Diagnosis and Prognosis of Industrial Networked Systems proposes linear mathematical tool sets that can be applied to realistic engineering systems. The book offers an overview of the fundamentals of vectors, matrices, and linear systems theory required for intelligent diagnosis and prognosis of industrial networked systems. Building on this theory, it then develops automated mathematical machineries and formal decision software tools for real-world applications. The book includes portable tool sets for many industrial applications, including: Forecasting machine tool wear in industrial cutting machines Reduction of sensors and features for industrial fault detection and isolation (FDI) Identification of critical resonant modes in mechatronic systems for system design of R&D Probabilistic small-signal stability in large-scale interconnected power systems Discrete event command and control for military applications The book also proposes future directions for intelligent diagnosis and prognosis in energy-efficient manufacturing, life cycle assessment, and systems of systems architecture. Written in a concise and accessible style, it presents tools that are mathematically rigorous but not involved. Bridging academia, research, and industry, this reference supplies the know-how for engineers and managers making decisions about equipment maintenance, as well as researchers and students in the field.","2011-06-23","http://books.google.es/books?id=Gn3Gi2TaidYC&pg=PA154&dq=contingency+%2B+networked&hl=&cd=36&source=gbs_api","1439840598",

As a conscious project to build a hybrid community both online and on-ground, Cyborganic's central premise was that mediated and face-to-face interaction are mutually sustaining and can be used together to build uniquely robust communities. Yet, Cyborganic was also an Internet start-up and the business project provided both impetus and infrastructure for the community. The social forms and cultural practices developed in this milieu figured in the initial development of Web publishing, and prefigured Web 2.0 in online collaboration, collective knowledge creation, and social networking.","2008","http://books.google.es/books?id=YWU_ouyd-c4C&pg=PA41&dq=contingency+%2B+networked&hl=&cd=37&source=gbs_api","0549973540",

Many ecological theories are mathematical, computational, or statistical, though, and rarely have attempts been made to organize or extrapolate these models into broader theories. The Theory of Ecology brings together some of the most respected and creative theoretical ecologists of this era to advance a comprehensive, conceptual articulation of ecological theories. The contributors cover a wide range of topics, from ecological niche theory to population dynamic theory to island biogeography theory. Collectively, the chapters ably demonstrate how theory in ecology accounts for observations about the natural world and how models provide predictive understandings. It organizes these models into constitutive domains that highlight the strengths and weaknesses of ecological understanding. This book is a milestone in ecological theory and is certain to motivate future empirical and theoretical work in one of the most exciting and active domains of the life sciences.","2011-07-15","http://books.google.es/books?id=qrcoS4K9gMQC&pg=PA61&dq=contingency+%2B+ecosystem&hl=&cd=4&source=gbs_api","9780226736860",

"The Ecosystem Approach to Marine Planning and Management","contingency + ecosystem","[Sue Kidd, Andy Plater, Chris Frid]","[Nature]","The marine environment is one of our most precious yet fragile natural resources. It provides a wide range of essential goods and services, including food, regulation of climate and nutrient cycling, as well as a setting for transport, recreation and tourism. This environment is however extremely complex and very sensitive to development pressures and other forms of human influence. Planning and management of the sea are similarly complicated, reflecting intricate legal, institutional and ownerships patterns. This creates a situation where marine ecosystems are vulnerable to over-exploitation or neglect. The Ecosystem Approach to Marine Planning and Management describes how growing concern about the state of our seas is resulting in the development of new approaches to marine planning and management. For example, the United Nations Environment Programme has called for the widespread introduction of Marine Spatial Planning (MSP), and the European Union has recently been consulting on a new European Maritime Policy designed to stimulate economic growth but at the same time protect the resource base. Within the United Kingdom, the 2010 Marine Act draws upon the experience of town and country planning and brings into being a new system of Marine Spatial Planning. The authors show that a common feature of all these developments is an appreciation that more integrated forms of planning and management are required for our seas and that new arrangements must draw together understanding from natural science, social science and many other perspectives. Adopting such a trans-disciplinary and holistic (or 'ecosystems') approach, the book distils the expertise of these different disciplines and seeks to promote a broader understanding of the origins and practicalities of new approaches to marine planning and management.","2011","http://books.google.es/books?id=ng4ocxF9oqQC&pg=PA94&dq=contingency+%2B+ecosystem&hl=&cd=9&source=gbs_api","9781849711821",
"Measures of Environmental Performance and Ecosystem Condition","contingency + ecosystem","[National Academy of Engineering]","[Science]","When Cleveland's Cuyahoga River caught fire in 1969, no environmental measurements were necessary to know the seriousness of the problem. Incidents like the Cuyahoga fire raise an important question: Can catastrophes-in-the-making be detected early enough to be prevented? For those in industry, such disasters point to the need for measures that can improve the environmental performance of processes, products, business practices, and linked industrial systems. In Measures of Environmental Performance and Ecosystem Condition, experts share their insights on environmental metrics. The volume explores the most productive relationship between measures of environmental performance and measures of ecosystem conditions. It reviews current approaches, evaluates structures for business decisionmaking, and includes a matrix for determining the environmental performance of industrial facilities. Case studies include: Development and application of a water-quality rating scheme for streams and reservoirs in the Tennessee Valley. Three years of successful experience with waste metrics at 3M. The book covers the range of environmental performance and condition metrics, from the use of material flow data to monitor environmental performance at the national level to the use of bioassays to measure the toxicity of industrial effluents. This book offers something for everyone--policymakers, executives, engineers, managers, and advocates--with a stake in the measurement of environmental performance and ecological conditions.","1999-06-02","http://books.google.es/books?id=1oSAW0avEQIC&pg=PA206&dq=contingency+%2B+ecosystem&hl=&cd=10&source=gbs_api","9780309175739",

Human settlements and flood-control structures have significantly reduced the Everglades, which once encompassed over three million acres of slow-moving water enriched by a diverse biota. To remedy the degradation of the Everglades, a comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan was formulated in 1999 with the goal of restoring the original hydrologic conditions of its remaining natural ecosystem. A major feature of this plan is providing enough storage capacity to meet human needs while also providing the needs of the greater Everglades ecosystem. This report reviews and evaluates not only storage options included in the Restoration Plan but also other options not considered in the Plan. Along with providing hydrologic and ecological analyses of the size, location and functioning of water storage components, the report also discusses and makes recommendations on related critical factors, such as timing of land acquisition, intermediate states of restoration, and tradeoffs among competing goals and ecosystem objectives.","2005-05-16","http://books.google.es/books?id=FACcAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA76&dq=contingency+%2B+ecosystem&hl=&cd=13&source=gbs_api","9780309095297",

Ecology and Ecosystem Conservation provides students and other readers with a basic understanding of the fundamental principles of ecological science and their applications, offering an essential overview of the way ecology can be used to devise strategies to conserve the health and functioning of ecosystems. The book begins by exploring the need for ecological science in understanding current environmental issues and briefly discussing what ecology is and isn’t. Subsequent chapters address critical issues in conservation and show how ecological science can be applied to them. The book explores questions such as: • What is the role of ecological science in decision making? • What factors govern the assembly of ecosystems and determine their response to various stressors? • How does Earth’s climate system function and determine the distribution of life on Earth? • What factors control the size of populations? • How does fragmentation of the landscape affect the persistence of species on the landscape? • How does biological diversity influence ecosystem processes?

Theoretical Foundations for a New Ecological Synthesis (MPB-46)","contingency + ecosystem","[Michel Loreau]","[Science]","The major subdisciplines of ecology--population ecology, community ecology, ecosystem ecology, and evolutionary ecology--have diverged increasingly in recent decades. What is critically needed today is an integrated, real-world approach to ecology that reflects the interdependency of biodiversity and ecosystem functioning. From Populations to Ecosystems proposes an innovative theoretical synthesis that will enable us to advance our fundamental understanding of ecological systems and help us to respond to today's emerging global ecological crisis. Michel Loreau begins by explaining how the principles of population dynamics and ecosystem functioning can be merged. He then addresses key issues in the study of biodiversity and ecosystems, such as functional complementarity, food webs, stability and complexity, material cycling, and metacommunities. Loreau describes the most recent theoretical advances that link the properties of individual populations to the aggregate properties of communities, and the properties of functional groups or trophic levels to the functioning of whole ecosystems, placing special emphasis on the relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning. Finally, he turns his attention to the controversial issue of the evolution of entire ecosystems and their properties, laying the theoretical foundations for a genuine evolutionary ecosystem ecology. From Populations to Ecosystems points the way to a much-needed synthesis in ecology, one that offers a fuller understanding of ecosystem processes in the natural world.","2010-07-01","http://books.google.es/books?id=qIxM7eNj9sUC&pg=PA67&dq=contingency+%2B+ecosystem&hl=&cd=24&source=gbs_api","9781400834167",

"The Agrarian Vision. Sustainability and Environmental Ethics","contingency + ecosystem","[Paul Thompson]","[Nature]","As industry and technology proliferate in modern society, sustainability has jumped to the forefront of contemporary political and environmental discussions. The balance between progress and the earth’s ability to provide for its inhabitants grows increasingly precarious as we attempt to achieve sustainable development. In The Agrarian Vision: Sustainability and Environmental Ethics, Paul B. Thompson articulates a new agrarian philosophy, emphasizing the vital role of agrarianism in modern agricultural practices. Thompson, a highly regarded voice in environmental philosophy, unites concepts of agrarian philosophy, political theory, and environmental ethics to illustrate the importance of creating and maintaining environmentally conscious communities. Thompson describes the evolution of agrarian values in America, following the path blazed by Thomas Jefferson, John Steinbeck, and Wendell Berry. Providing a pragmatic approach to ecological responsibility and commitment, The Agrarian Vision is a significant, compelling argument for the practice of a reconfigured and expanded agrarianism in our efforts to support modern industrialized culture while also preserving the natural world.","2010-07-30","http://books.google.es/books?id=7V05fNliu4sC&pg=PA227&dq=contingency+%2B+ecosystem&hl=&cd=33&source=gbs_api","9780813173818",

"Phenology of Ecosystem Processes. Applications in Global Change Research","contingency + ecosystem","[Asko Noormets]","[Science]","Terrestrial carbon balance is uncertain at the regional and global scale. A significant source of variability in mid-latitude ecosystems is related to the timing and duration of phenological phases. Spring phenology, in particular, has disproportionate effects on the annual carbon balance. However, the traditional phenological indices that are based on leaf-out and flowering times of select indicator species are not universally amenable for predicting the temporal dynamics of ecosystem carbon and water exchange. Phenology of Ecosystem Processes evaluates current applications of traditional phenology in carbon and H2O cycle research, as well as the potential to identify phenological signals in ecosystem processes themselves. The book summarizes recent progress in the understanding of the seasonal dynamics of ecosystem carbon and H2O fluxes, the novel use of various methods (stable isotopes, time-series, forward and inverse modeling), and the implications for remote sensing and global carbon cycle modeling. Each chapter includes a literature review, in order to present the state-of-the-science in the field and enhance the book s usability as an educational aid, as well as a case study to exemplify the use and applicability of various methods. Chapters that apply a specific methodology summarize the successes and challenges of particular methods for quantifying the seasonal changes in ecosystem carbon, water and energy fluxes. The book will benefit global change researchers, modelers, and advanced students.","2009-06-19","http://books.google.es/books?id=k_yIb4fWmPsC&pg=PA184&dq=contingency+%2B+ecosystem&hl=&cd=39&source=gbs_api","1441900268",

However, this position of leadership is not a birthright, and it is now under pressure. In recent years, the rapid globalization of markets, labor pools, and capital flows have encouraged many strong national competitors. During the same period, national policies have not sufficiently buttressed the ecosystem, or have generated side effects that have reduced its effectiveness. As a result, the U.S. position in IT leadership today has materially eroded compared with that of prior decades, and the nation risks ceding IT leadership to other nations within a generation. Assessing the Impacts of Changes in the Information Technology R&D Ecosystem calls for a recommitment to providing the resources needed to fuel U.S. IT innovation, to removing important roadblocks that reduce the ecosystem's effectiveness in generating innovation and the fruits of innovation, and to becoming a lead innovator and user of IT.

Although this approach has been applied mainly to terrestrial ecosystems, there is increasing interest in quantifying macroecological patterns in the sea and understanding the processes that generate them. Taking stock of the current work in the field and advocating a research agenda for the decades ahead, Marine Macroecology draws together insights and approaches from a diverse group of scientists to show how marine ecology can benefit from the adoption of macroecological approaches. Divided into three parts, Marine Macroecology first provides an overview of marine diversity patterns and offers case studies of specific habitats and taxonomic groups. In the second part, contributors focus on process-based explanations for marine ecological patterns. The third part presents new approaches to understanding processes driving the macroecolgical patterns in the sea. Uniting unique insights from different perspectives with the common goal of identifying and understanding large-scale biodiversity patterns, Marine Macroecology will inspire the next wave of marine ecologists to approach their research from a macroecological perspective.","2009-10-15","http://books.google.es/books?id=a9Qv-DgnDkoC&pg=PA31&dq=contingency+%2B+ecosystems&hl=&cd=12&source=gbs_api","0226904148",
"Central European Stream Ecosystems. The Long Term Study of the Breitenbach","contingency + ecosystems","[Rüdiger Wagner, Jürgen Marxsen, Peter Zwick, Eileen J.

While the main emphasis has been for many years on lakes due to their limited capacity of self-renewal, streams and rivers attract increasing attention due to their importance for agriculture, fisheries, drinking water reserves and as feeder of freshwater lakes and reservoirs. There are many factors influencing the ecology of streams, only some of them relating to direct anthropogenic influences and it is important to have reliable long term data on natural occurring variations in order to better estimate the `default’ status of a stream and to judge the influence of modern anthropogenic influences. The Breitenbach is one of the best-studied streams on earth, as the nearby Max-Planck Outstation in Schlitz was founded in 1949 and scientists there have been collecting data ever since. Central European Stream Ecosystems: The Long Term Study of the Breitenbach is the result of this research, and special focus has been placed on animal and microorganism occurrence and variation as well as chemical and physical parameters. Already this data influences the discussion of the `good ecological state’ reference values and it will be in particular useful to analyze the effect of global warming on the ecology of streams. An invaluable data basis for modeling purposes, this important book is a useful resource for everyone in the world dealing with stream ecology, for example limnologists, ecologists, biologists and hydrologists.","2011-10-24","http://books.google.es/books?id=UbCyQlIrUwsC&pg=PT568&dq=contingency+%2B+ecosystems&hl=&cd=13&source=gbs_api","9783527634668",

The goal of the MA is to establish the scientific basis for actions needed to enhance the contribution of ecosystems to human well-being without undermining their long-term productivity. With contributions by more than 500 scientists from 70 countries, the MA has proven to be one of the most important conservation initiatives ever undertaken, and the ecosystem services paradigm on which it is based provides the standard for practice. This manual supplies the specific tools that practitioners of the paradigm need in order to extend their work into the future. The manual is a stand-alone “how to” guide to conducting assessments of the impacts on humans of ecosystem changes. In addition, assessment practitioners who are looking for guidance on particular aspects of the assessment process will find individual chapters of this manual to be useful in advancing their understanding of best practices in ecosystem assessment. The manual builds on the experiences and lessons learned from the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment global and sub-global assessment initiatives, with chapters written by well-known participants in those initiatives.

"The Comparative Roles of Suspension-Feeders in Ecosystems. Proceedings of the NATO Advanced Research Workshop on The Comparative Roles of Suspension-Feeders in Ecosystems, Nida, Lithuania, 4-9 October 2003","contingency + ecosystems","[Richard F. Dame, Sergej Olenin]","[Nature]","Animals are a major link between the water column (pelagic) and the bottom (benthic) habitats in most shallow systems. This coupling is dominated by active processes such as suspension-feeding in which the organism actively uses energy to pump water that is then filtered to remove suspended particles that are consumed while undigested remains are deposited on the bottom. As a result of this feeding on and metabolism of particles, the animals excrete dissolved inorganic and organic waste back into the water column, and thus, become major components in the cycling and feedback of essential elements. With relatively high weight specific filtration rates of 1 10 liters/hour/gram dry tissue and a propensity to form large aggregated populations (beds, reefs, schools and swarms), these organisms can play an important role in regulating water column processes Although estuarine bivalve molluscs such as oysters and mussels dominate the suspension-feeder literature, other groups including plankton and nekton that are found in estuarine as well as other aquatic systems are also potentially important removers of suspended particles. Thus, a significant part of the NATO Advanced Research Workshop focused on suspension-feeders as controllers of plankton abundance, biomass and diversity, system metabolism, nutrient cycling and scale dependency. Systems dominated by suspension-feeders are typically impacted by human activities including recreation, aquaculture, human and industrial pollution, and bilge water from shipping. Suspension-feeders are often impacted by fisheries and over-exploitation. These impacts commonly result in changes in ecosystem structure either through the food chain concentration of harmful substances or diseases, the introduction of alien species of suspension-feeders, or the instability of suspension-feeders systems through species displacement or phase shifts in the dominance between different suspension-feeding components such asnekton or zooplankton. These issues were addressed near the close of the workshop along with conclusions and syntheses developed by the working groups.","2006-03-30","http://books.google.es/books?id=JkxIak734P8C&pg=PA266&dq=contingency+%2B+ecosystems&hl=&cd=23&source=gbs_api","9781402030307",

"Contingency theory. rethinking the boundaries of social thought","contingency + ecosystems","[Gary Itzkowitz]","[Social Science]","A major task for social theory in the 1990s is to explain the relationship between individuals and social structures. This book makes two simple suggestions for forging a micro/macro link. First, theorists should abandon their search for universal laws governing society. Second, abandoning overarching laws does not leave postmodern mayhem as the only alternative. Following twentieth century scientific discoveries, this book argues that while micro and macro social processes remain related, they do so only as an aftermath of autonomous developments in each level. Since the two autonomous levels may emerge at odds, or in tandem, their relationship becomes contingent and unpredictable. The concept of contingency is a breakthrough for social theory. Where current micro/macro debates are merely an expanded, but veiled, regurgitation of philosophical issues debated long ago, the concept of contigency allows social theory to transcend old paradigms and explain contemporary society.","1996-09-30","http://books.google.es/books?id=r67pAAAAIAAJ&q=contingency+%2B+ecosystems&dq=contingency+%2B+ecosystems&hl=&cd=40&source=gbs_api","UCSC:32106014514167",

This volume, combining contributions from leading policy makers and academics, is the essential introduction to the issues. Must reading.Õ Ð Barry Eichengreen, George C. Pardee and Helen N. Pardee Professor of Economics and Political Science, University of California, Berkeley, US ÔThere was a world BC (Before Crisis) and there will be a world AD (After Deleveraging) Ð the challenge is to create an effective, efficient yet stable and sustainable financial system for this Ònew worldÓ. This book provides the most comprehensive and thought-provoking basis for action I have seen so far.Õ Ð Paul Achleitner, Chair of Supervisory Board Deutsche Bank AG ÔFinancial stability is an overarching goal. In open and democratic societies, ensuring financial stability is a matter of interest not only to central bankers, academics and financial market players, but also to all well-informed citizens. This book provides an excellent basis for a wide-ranging and rewarding debate.Õ Ð Thomas J. Jordan, Chairman of the Governing Board of the Swiss National Bank ÔThe financial crisis demonstrated conclusively that for central bankers and other policymakers financial stability must always be of paramount concern, for without it the macroeconomy will perform badly and monetary policy will lose its effectiveness. This book underscores the importance of financial stability, laying out the key issues and what must be done to avoid such disasters in the future.Õ Ð William C. Dudley, President of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, US In the aftermath of the financial crisis, new financial market regulation is being implemented, and increasing numbers of countries are establishing new legislation for macroprudential oversight. Against this backdrop, this thought provoking book provides a platform for the leading international experts to discuss and encourage future debate on financial stability. The breadth and scope of the issues addressed reflect the challenge of developing and consistently implementing a coherent set of financial reforms to promote financial stability. The book advocates the development of financial reforms that are effective in striking the optimal balance between realizing the enormous benefits of efficient financial intermediation, capital allocation and risk management on the one hand, and controlling systemic risks and maintaining financial stability on the other. Making an important contribution to deepening our understanding of the many facets of financial stability, this book will prove a challenging read for policy makers, regulators and central bankers as well as for researchers and scholars in the fields of economics, money, finance and banking.","2013-01-01","http://books.google.es/books?id=DnO-vHP8WkUC&pg=PA289&dq=hazard+%2B+systemic&hl=&cd=3&source=gbs_api","9781782547846",
"Bailouts and Systemic Insurance","hazard + systemic","[Mr. Giovanni Dell'Ariccia, Lev Ratnovski]","[Business & Economics]","We revisit the link between bailouts and bank risk taking. The expectation of government support to failing banks creates moral hazard increases bank risk taking. However, when a bank s success depends on both its effort and the overall stability of the banking system, a government s commitment to shield banks from contagion may increase their incentives to invest prudently and so reduce bank risk taking. This systemic insurance effect will be relatively more important when bailout rents are low and the risk of contagion (upon a bank failure) is high. The optimal policy may then be not to try to avoid bailouts, but to make them effective : associated with lower rents.","2013-11-12","http://books.google.es/books?id=VdJPAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA1&dq=hazard+%2B+systemic&hl=&cd=5&source=gbs_api","9781475517514",

"Restructuring Regulation and Financial Institutions","hazard + systemic","[James R. Barth, R. Dan Brumbaugh, Glenn Yago]","[Business & Economics]","Policy makers around the globe will find that Restructuring Regulation and Financial Institutions offers a cogent assessment of the contemporary regulatory environment in the U.S. financial markets, and a blueprint for action in evolving global financial markets. Financial markets are among the most highly-regulated markets in the world. Nevertheless, financial crises still occur, witness the U.S. savings-and-loan fiasco of the late 1980s and early 1990s, and the Mexican and East Asian Financial implosions of 1994 and 1997. What role does regulation play in stabilizing-or-destabilizing financial markets? Restructuring Regulation and Financial Institutions answers this question with incisive analysis of financial market regulation in the United States. Each paper considers how regulation enhances or impedes the efficiency of a particular financial sector, and is followed by comments by two or three noted experts. The result of this approach is a wealth of useful information that may be applied by policy makers contemplating the restructuring of regulations and financial institutions. The contributors to this volume are distinguished economists, many of whom have careers not just in business, government, or academia, but have held influential positions in all three. Such varied backgrounds enable the contributors to offer remarkable insights based on the best of theory and practice. Never before has understanding the workings of U.S. financial market regulation been so important to the development of world financial markets. The ramifications of financial regulation in the United States extend far beyond the nation's borders. World financial markets are undergoing dramatic change, driven by the rapid development and deployment of new technology that enables information-and money-to travel farther, faster. However, a Byzantine array of regulatory structures in the international arena hinders the development of efficient global financial markets. Policy makers around the world are attempting to address the issues by emulating the financial markets of the United States.","2001-08-31","http://books.google.es/books?id=mAHsmzdUbsIC&pg=PA320&dq=hazard+%2B+systemic&hl=&cd=15&source=gbs_api","0792373642",

"Operational Risk Assessment. The Commercial Imperative of a more Forensic and Transparent Approach","hazard + systemic","[Brendon Young, Rodney Coleman]","[Business & Economics]","Operational risk assessment The Commercial Imperative of a More Forensic and Transparent Approach Brendon Young and Rodney Coleman “Brendon Young and Rodney Coleman's book is extremely timely. There has never been a greater need for the financial industry to reassess the way it looks at risk. […] They are right to draw attention to the current widespread practices of risk management, which […] have allowed risk to become underpriced across the entire industry.” Rt Hon John McFall MP, Chairman, House of Commons Treasury Committee Failure of the financial services sector to properly understand risk was clearly demonstrated by the recent 'credit crunch'. In its 2008 Global Stability Report, the IMF sharply criticised banks and other financial institutions for the failure of risk management systems, resulting in excessive risk-taking. Financial sector supervision and regulation was also criticised for lagging behind shifts in business models and rapid innovation. This book provides investors with a sound understanding of the approaches used to assess the standing of firms and determine their true potential (identifying probable losers and potential longer-term winners). It advocates a 'more forensic' approach towards operational risk management and promotes transparency, which is seen as a facilitator of competition and efficiency as well as being a barrier to fraud, corruption and financial crime. Risk assessment is an integral part of informed decision making, influencing strategic positioning and direction. It is fundamental to a company’s performance and a key differentiator between competing management teams. Increasing complexity is resulting in the need for more dynamic, responsive approaches to the assessment and management of risk. Not all risks can be quantified; however, it remains incumbent upon management to determine the impact of possible risk-events on financial statements and to indicate the level of variation in projected figures. To begin, the book looks at traditional methods of risk assessment and shows how these have developed into the approaches currently being used. It then goes on to consider the more advanced forensic techniques being developed, which will undoubtedly increase understanding. The authors identify 'best practice' and address issues such as the importance of corporate governance, culture and ethics. Insurance as a mitigant for operational risk is also considered. Quantitative and qualitative risk assessment methodologies covered include: Loss-data analysis; extreme value theory; causal analysis including Bayesian Belief Networks; control risk self-assessment and key indicators; scenario analysis; and dynamic financial analysis. Views of industry insiders, from organisations such as Standard & Poors, Fitch, Hermes, USS, UN-PRI, Deutsche Bank, and Alchemy Partners, are presented together with those from experts at the FSA, the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB), and the Financial Reporting Council. In addition to investors, this book will be of interest to actuaries, rating agencies, regulators and legislators, as well as to the directors and risk managers of financial institutions in both the private and public sectors. Students requiring a comprehensive knowledge of operational risk management will also find the book of considerable value.","2010-12-03","http://books.google.es/books?id=jd0cr_hjnmMC&pg=PA201&dq=hazard+%2B+systemic&hl=&cd=18&source=gbs_api","9780470745991",

"Enhancing Biocontrol Agents and Handling Risks","hazard + systemic","[Maurizio Vurro]","[Medical]","The increased relevance given to life and food quality, and environment preservation must be balanced with the needs to produce enough food to sustain humanity. Food production without pest (weed, disease and insect) control is impossible. The environmental considerations as well as the evolution of pesticide resistances requires that chemical pest control be augmented and significantly supplanted by other procedures. Despite many promising results obtained using biological control agents, their utility is still quite limited, replacing only a small part of the market of chemical products. This is due to many reasons, such as difficulties to find new and suitable agents, technological limits in application, storage and formulation of organisms, environmental restrictions of application, costs of registering, producing and delivering biopesticides. The major reason though is that very few agents have the efficacy of traditional chemicals, yet typically costing more than chemical pesticides The advent of biotechnologies and molecular biology has opened new perspectives in using microrganisms in biocontrol, by allowing improvements in the properties of biocontrol agents and their delivery. The potential new risks associated with the introduction of new genes and organisms must be adequately accessed, which is a recurring motif throughout the proposed program. It is only if these issues are fully and transparently addressed can the necessary lines of communication be opened to the public. The book preserves, as the NATO workshop which generated it, a subject-oriented structure that could attract the interest of the scientific community working with different biological agents (fungi, bacteria, virus, nematodes, insects), on different targets (pathogens, insects, weeds). This multi-disciplinary approach (molecular biology, formulation, genetics, risk assessment, new technology, biochemistry, physiology) is necessary to design biocontrol agents with improved efficacy. It is hoped that by investing in this type of multi-disciplinary area that research will lead to new and improved agents that will be ready for use at about the time when the food supply becomes limiting, or when resistance to the few remaining conventional pesticides becomes a major limitation.","2001-01-01","http://books.google.es/books?id=TOkfYzOgbzMC&pg=PA159&dq=hazard+%2B+systemic&hl=&cd=21&source=gbs_api","158603216X",

Current macroprudential policy and surveillance (MPS) efforts are aimed establishing a regulatory framework that helps mitigate the risk from systemic linkages with a view towards enhancing the resilience of the financial sector. This paper presents a forward-looking framework (""Systemic CCA"") to measure systemic solvency risk based on market-implied expected losses of financial institutions with practical applications for the financial sector risk management and the system-wide capital assessment in top-down stress testing. The suggested approach uses advanced contingent claims analysis (CCA) to generate aggregate estimates of the joint default risk of multiple institutions as a conditional tail expectation using multivariate extreme value theory (EVT). In addition, the framework also helps quantify the individual contributions to systemic risk and contingent liabilities of the financial sector during times of stress.","2013-02-27","http://books.google.es/books?id=ZoS2W2UXscMC&pg=PA33&dq=hazard+%2B+systemic&hl=&cd=31&source=gbs_api","1557755019",

"Collective Moral Hazard, Maturity Mismatch and Systemic Bailouts","hazard + systemic","[Emmanuel Farhi, Jean Tirole, National Bureau of Economic Research]","[Banks and banking]","The paper elicits a mechanism by which private leverage choices exhibit strategic complementarities through the reaction of monetary policy. When everyone engages in maturity transformation, authorities have little choice but facilitating refinancing. In turn, refusing to adopt a risky balance sheet lowers the return on equity. The key ingredient is that monetary policy is non-targeted. The ex post benefits from a monetary bailout accrue in proportion to the number amount of leverage, while the distortion costs are to a large extent fixed. This insight has important consequences. First, banks choose to correlate their risk exposures. Second, private borrowers may deliberately choose to increase their interest-rate sensitivity following bad news about future needs for liquidity. Third, optimal monetary policy is time inconsistent. Fourth, there is a role for macro-prudential supervision. We characterize the optimal regulation, which takes the form of a minimum liquidity requirement coupled with monitoring of the quality of liquid assets. We establish the robustness of our insights when the set of bailout instruments is endogenous and characterize the structure of optimal bailouts.","2009","http://books.google.es/books?id=oV5enQEACAAJ&dq=hazard+%2B+systemic&hl=&cd=34&source=gbs_api","OCLC:427636884",

"Catastrophe Modeling. A New Approach to Managing Risk","hazard + structure","[Patricia Grossi, Howard Kunreuther]","[Business & Economics]","Catastrophe Modeling: A New Approach to Managing Risk is the first book that systematically analyzes how catastrophe models can be used for assessing and managing risks of extreme events. It focuses on natural disaster risk, but also discusses the management of terrorism risk. A unique feature of this book is the involvement of three leading catastrophe modeling firms, AIR Worldwide, EQECAT, and Risk Management Solutions, who examine the role of catastrophe modeling in rate setting, portfolio management and risk financing. Using data from three model cities (Oakland, CA, Long Beach, CA and Miami/Dade County, FLA), experts from the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania examine the role of catastrophe modeling to develop risk management strategies for reducing and spreading the losses from future disasters. Given the uncertainties associated with terrorism the book points out the opportunities for utilizing catastrophe models to set insurance rates and to examine public-private partnerships for providing financial assistance in the event of a terrorist attack. ""This book fills a critical need in setting forth the role of modern risk analysis in managing catastrophe risk. There is no comparable reference work for this important subject area. The book is well written and well organized. It contains contributions from many of the most distinguished experts in the fields of risk analysis and risk management. It strikes a good balance between the technical aspects of the subject and the practical aspects of decision making."" ""This book is strongly recommended for individuals who must make decisions regarding the management of impacts of catastrophe risks including those in both the public and private sector."" Wilfred D. Iwan Professor of Applied Mechanics, Emeritus Director, Earthquake Engineering Research Laboratory California Institute of Technology ""The authors have captured the essence of catastrophe modeling: its value, its utility and its limitations.

"The Impact of Blind Bidding on Market Structure and Performance in the U.S. Motion Picture Industry","hazard + structure","[Daniel Wedzielewski]","[Letting of contracts]","From 1975-1985, theater owners were required to bid on films without seeing them, an industry practice referred to as ""blind bidding."" Movie companies considered blind bidding a necessary way to finance blockbuster films, but theater owners claimed that blind bidding resulted in the overbidding of poor quality films. In response to the lobbying of theater owners, twenty-four states passed anti-blind bidding laws between 1978--1984. This dissertation investigates claims made by theater owners and movie companies about the impact of blind bidding on the survival rates of independent theaters, admission prices, and delays in the release of films. I find the anti-blind bidding laws significantly helped theater owners remain in business longer. However, the beneficial effect was short-lived. In addition, I find that the laws raised admission prices but did not cause delays in release dates.","2008","http://books.google.es/books?id=Zy5eKeU5XbMC&pg=PA87&dq=hazard+%2B+structure&hl=&cd=26&source=gbs_api","0549924981",

Part of this task includes ensuring for design features and modifications that will minimize hazardous conditions during construction and life of the structure. Identifying the hazards that most commonly endanger the users during the life cycle of the building facility is the primary objective of this book. This objective is accomplished by instructing the engineer how to sidestep these hazards at the time of design and construction. This book delves into the cause of many hazards common to construction, including fire, maintenance, mold, structural failure, and operational conditions and details ways to minimize or avoid these conditions, reducing the possibility of injury and damage. Comprehensively organized from the “ground up”, this book covers all phases of any major building project. Part One addresses the concepts of hazard, liability, and ways system safety engineering works to overcome human error. Part Two covers possible hazards encountered in both interior and exterior construction plans and offers ways to eliminate them before any construction begins. Part Three covers safe construction techniques to minimize unavoidable hazards, while Part Four extends into the post-construction life of the building and outlines optimal safe practices for the user/occupant.","2005","http://books.google.es/books?id=0a2byo0hi9sC&printsec=frontcover&dq=hazard+%2B+structure&hl=&cd=38&source=gbs_api","9780913875315",

Benefiting from the author’s extensive career in structural and earthquake engineering, dynamic analysis and lecturing, it is written from an industry perspective at a level suitable for graduate students. Fundamentals of Seismic Loading on Structures is organised into four major sections: introduction to earthquakes and related engineering problems, analysis, seismic loading, and design concepts. From a practical perspective, reviews linear and non-linear behaviour, introduces concepts of uniform hazard spectra, discusses loading provisions in design codes and examines soil-structure interaction issues, allowing the reader to quickly identify and implement information in a working environment. Discusses probabilistic methods that are widely employed in the assessment of seismic hazard, illustrating the use of Monte Carlo simulation with a number of worked examples. Summarises the latest developments in the field such as performance-based seismic engineering and advances in liquefaction research. “There are many books on earthquake engineering, but few are of direct use to the practising structural designer.

"Life Settlements and Longevity Structures. Pricing and Risk Management","hazard + structures","[Geoff Chaplin, Jim Aspinwall, Mark Venn]","[Business & Economics]","Recent turbulence in the financial markets has highlighted the need for diversified portfolios with lower correlations between the different investments. Life settlements meet this need, offering investors the prospect of high, stable returns, uncorrelated with the broader financial markets. This book provides readers of all levels of experience with essential information on the process surrounding the acquisition and management of a portfolio of life settlements; the assessment, modelling and mitigation of the associated longevity, interest rate and credit risks; and practical approaches to financing and risk management structures. It begins with the history of life insurance and looks at how the need for new financing sources has led to the growth of the life settlements market in the United States. The authors provide a detailed exploration of the mathematical formulae surrounding the generation of mortality curves, drawing a parallel between the tools deployed in the credit derivatives market and those available to model longevity risk. Structured products and securitisation techniques are introduced and explained, starting with simple vanilla products and models before illustrating some of the investment structures associated with life settlements. Capital market mechanisms available to assist the investor in limiting the risks associated with life settlement portfolios are outlined, as are opportunities to use life settlement portfolios to mitigate the risks of traditional capital markets. The last section of the book covers derivative products, either available now or under consideration, that will reduce or potentially eliminate longevity risks within life settlement portfolios. It then reviews hedging and risk management strategies and considers how to measure the effectiveness of risk mitigation.","2009-08-06","http://books.google.es/books?id=Rf2VAAAAQBAJ&pg=PT46&dq=hazard+%2B+structures&hl=&cd=18&source=gbs_api","9780470684856",

"Earthquake-Resistant Structures. Design, Build, and Retrofit","hazard + structures","[Mohiuddin Ali Khan]","[Technology & Engineering]","Earthquake engineering is the ultimate challenge for structural engineers. Even if natural phenomena involve great uncertainties, structural engineers need to design buildings, bridges, and dams capable of resisting the destructive forces produced by them. These disasters have created a new awareness about the disaster preparedness and mitigation. Before a building, utility system, or transportation structure is built, engineers spend a great deal of time analyzing those structures to make sure they will perform reliably under seismic and other loads. The purpose of this book is to provide structural engineers with tools and information to improve current building and bridge design and construction practices and enhance their sustainability during and after seismic events. In this book, Khan explains the latest theory, design applications and Code Provisions.

This book presents international experience in design and construction practice and describes recent improvements in analysis and prediction methods. Recent research results include new guidance on wave loadings; advances in predicting wave overtopping; effects of climate change on coastal flooding; and improvements in hazard and reliability analysis. Papers on wave overtopping and wave loadings have significantly improved the understanding of the complex processes involved, with new guidance from the European CLASH project on the magnitude of overtopping hazards and their distributions, methods to correct scale and model effects for low discharge overtopping, and use of new prediction tools including Neural Networks and numerical models. The importance of good understanding and prediction tools for overtopping responses is illustrated by papers on seawall experience from Japan, reliability methods for sea defences in the UK, and results from the major Foresight project on flood risks over the next 30-100 years.","2005-01-01","http://books.google.es/books?id=wFKUcovQnt4C&pg=PA231&dq=hazard+%2B+structures&hl=&cd=21&source=gbs_api","0727734555",

Covering a series of important topics, which are of current research interest and have many practical applications, the conference is concerned with all aspects of risk analysis and hazard mitigation, ranging from specific assessment of risk to mitigation associated with both natural and anthropogenic hazards. The analysis and management of risk and the mitigation of hazards is of fundamental importance to planners and researchers around the world. We live in an increasingly complex society with the potential for disasters on a worldwide scale. Scientific knowledge is essential to our better understanding of risk. Natural hazards such as floods, earthquakes, landslides, fires and others, have always affected human societies. Man-made hazards, however, played a comparatively small role until the industrial revolution when the risk of catastrophic events started to increase due to the rapid growth of new technologies. The interaction of natural and anthropogenic risks adds to the complexity of the problem. Advances in computational methods and the ability to model systems more precisely now enables hazards to be quantified, their effects to be simulated and risk analysis to be pursued with greater accuracy, providing for more effective risk management. These developments are not only important for all areas of human endeavour but have particular relevance to environmental issues where the risks involved are substantial. Effective risk management and the mitigation of possible hazards have become a high priority of government and a public concern.","2010-08-01","http://books.google.es/books?id=Om4aZO1uDzcC&pg=PT36&dq=hazard+%2B+network&hl=&cd=5&source=gbs_api","9781845644727",

"Earthquake Monitoring and Seismic Hazard Mitigation in Balkan Countries","hazard + network","[Eystein Sverre Husebye]","[Computer Applications in Earth Sciences]","Seismology is rated the Queen of Earth Sciences due to its ability to provide detailed structural information bearing on the Earth interior and on-going dynamic processes. This is due to the advanced theoretical foundation of seismology and the extensive cooperation among seismologists on recording and disseminating of data worldwide. In contrast, some 40 years ago seismology was a backward science and hence funding was poor. This abruptly changed with the political interest in seismology as the principal tool for monitoring compliance with a potential Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban treaty (CTBT) banning nuclear testing in any environment. Major countries like USA, UK and USSR launched large-scale research programs including deployment of modern seismograph stations and arrays and these developments are detailed in the book for CTBTO (UN), IRIS (USA), MedNet (Italy), Geofon (Germany) and the tiny Karelia network, NW Russia. Station and network operations require near real time record analysis and topics dealt with here are 2-D signal detector, epicenter location and earthquake monitoring. Balkan is seismically the most active part of Europe due to multiple plate interactions in the Aegean Sea. The tectonic evolution and on-going geodynamic deformations are described in 2 articles. Earthquake hazard analysis and topographic site effects are discussed and likewise large earthquake hazards in the Aegean and the Marmara seas relate to practical applications of such procedures. Foremost; the book gives a good account of past, present and likely future seismological developments in Balkan countries and various kinds of network operations on local to global scales.","2008-03-01","http://books.google.es/books?id=vwK4jhvjHQkC&pg=PA220&dq=hazard+%2B+network&hl=&cd=8&source=gbs_api","9781402068157",

Because of the geographical extent of U.S. coastlines, an earthquake in Alaska can generate a local tsunami for Alaskans and, hours later, a distant tsunami for communities in Hawaii and along the Pacific Coast . This volume chronicles the development and accomplishments of a joint State/Federal partnership that was forged to reduce tsunami hazards along U.S. coastlines – the National Tsunami Hazard Mitigation Program. By integrating hazard assessment, warning guidance, and mitigation activities, the program has created a roadmap and a set of tools to develop communities more resilient to local and distant tsunamis.

"Pathways to Urban Sustainability. Research and Development on Urban Systems","hazard + network","[Committee on the Challenge of Developing Sustainable Urban Systems, Science and Technology for Sustainability Program, Policy and Global Affairs, National Research Council]","[Technology & Engineering]","More than half of the world's people now live in cities. In the United States, the figure is 80 percent. It is worthwhile to consider how this trend of increased urbanization, if inevitable, could be made more sustainable. One fundamental shortcoming of urban research and programs is that they sometimes fail to recognize urban areas as systems. Current institutions and actors are not accustomed to exploring human-environment interactions, particularly at an urban-scale. The fact is that these issues involve complex interactions, many of which are not yet fully understood. Thus a key challenge for the 21st century is this: How can we develop sustainable urban systems that provide healthy, safe and affordable environments for the growing number of Americans living in cities and their surrounding metropolitan areas? To address this question, the National Research Council organized a workshop exploring the landscape of urban sustainability research programs in the United States. The workshop, summarized in this volume, was designed to allow participants to share information about the activities and planning efforts of federal agencies, along with related initiatives by universities, the private sector, nongovernmental groups, state and local agencies, and international organizations. Participants were encouraged to explore how urban sustainability can move beyond analyses devoted to single disciplines and sectors to systems-level thinking and effective interagency cooperation. To do this, participants examined areas of potential coordination among different R&D programs, with special consideration given to how the efforts of federal agencies can best complement and leverage the efforts of other key stakeholders. Pathways to Urban Sustainability offers a broad contextual summary of workshop presentations and discussions for distribution to federal agencies, regional organizations, academic institutions, think tanks and other groups engaged in urban research.","2010-09-21","http://books.google.es/books?id=kO-Gxx5deAoC&pg=PA86&dq=hazard+%2B+network&hl=&cd=19&source=gbs_api","9780309158954",

The book uses an integrative approach to address socio-cultural, political and physical components of the disaster process. Human and social vulnerability as well as risk to environmental hazards are explored within the comprehensive context of diverse natural hazards and disasters. In addition to scientific explanations of disastrous occurrences, people and governments of hazard-prone countries often have their own interpretations for why natural disasters occur. In such interpretations they often either blame others, in order to conceal their inability to protect themselves, or they blame themselves, attributing the events to either real or imagined misdeeds. The book contains a chapter devoted to the neglected topic of such reactions and explanations. Includes chapters on key topics such as the application of GIS in hazard studies; resiliency; disasters and poverty; climate change and sustainability and development. This book is designed as a primary text for an interdisciplinary course on hazards for upper-level undergraduate and Graduate students. Although not targeted for an introductory hazards course, students in such a course may find it very useful as well. Additionally, emergency managers, planners, and both public and private organizations involved in disaster response, and mitigation could benefit from this book along with hazard researchers. It not only includes traditional and popular hazard topics (e.g., disaster cycles, disaster relief, and risk and vulnerability), it also includes neglected topics, such as the positive impacts of disasters, disaster myths and different accounts of disasters, and disasters and gender.","2011-11-01","http://books.google.es/books?id=F7i4KeOUe3cC&pg=PT104&dq=hazard+%2B+network&hl=&cd=21&source=gbs_api","9781119951025",
"Living on an Active Earth. Perspectives on Earthquake Science","hazard + network","[Committee on the Science of Earthquakes, Board on Earth Sciences and Resources, Division on Earth and Life Studies, National Research Council]","[Nature]","The destructive force of earthquakes has stimulated human inquiry since ancient times, yet the scientific study of earthquakes is a surprisingly recent endeavor. Instrumental recordings of earthquakes were not made until the second half of the 19th century, and the primary mechanism for generating seismic waves was not identified until the beginning of the 20th century. From this recent start, a range of laboratory, field, and theoretical investigations have developed into a vigorous new discipline: the science of earthquakes. As a basic science, it provides a comprehensive understanding of earthquake behavior and related phenomena in the Earth and other terrestrial planets. As an applied science, it provides a knowledge base of great practical value for a global society whose infrastructure is built on the Earth's active crust. This book describes the growth and origins of earthquake science and identifies research and data collection efforts that will strengthen the scientific and social contributions of this exciting new discipline.","2003-09-05","http://books.google.es/books?id=YqcTwur1sRAC&pg=PA415&dq=hazard+%2B+network&hl=&cd=22&source=gbs_api","9780309169097",
"Advanced Methods for Decision Making and Risk Management in Sustainability Science","hazard + network","[Jürgen Kropp, Jürgen Scheffran]","[Business & Economics]","Understanding sustainability is vital to resolving and managing many of today's problems, on a global as well as local scale. Sustainability science is an emerging field of research that comprises concepts and methodologies from different disciplines in a problem-oriented manner. Research efforts are often concentrated in a variety of sectoral domains. The heterogeneity of scientific tasks involved here and the complexity of environmental and social systems call for specific research strategies which are generally a compromise between high-precision analysis and educated guesswork. For understanding of global change, which embraces a variety of processes on several scales, information needs to be refined and compressed rather than amplified. This book aims at presenting advanced methods and techniques to make them available to a wider scientific community involved in global change and sustainability research. The contributions describe novel schemes to study the relationship between the socio-economic and the natural sphere and/or the social dimensions of climate and global change. The methodological approaches can be useful in the design and management of environmental systems, for policy development, environmental risk reduction, and prevention/mitigation strategies. In this context, a variety of environmental and sustainability aspects can be addressed, e.g. changes in the natural environment and land use, environmental impacts on human health, economics and technology, institutional interactions, human activities and behaviour.","2007","http://books.google.es/books?id=rsXPKdacqyMC&pg=PA243&dq=hazard+%2B+network&hl=&cd=23&source=gbs_api","1600214274",

"Infrasound Monitoring for Atmospheric Studies","hazard + network","[Alexis Le Pichon, Dr. Elisabeth Blanc, Alain Hauchecorne]","[Science]","The infrasound field, the science of low-frequency acoustic waves, has developed into a broad interdisciplinary field encompassing academic disciplines of physics and recent technical and scientific developments. In 1996, the United Nations General Assembly adopted the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT), prohibiting atmospheric nuclear explosions worldwide. The infrasound network of the International Monitoring Network (IMS) of the CTBT-Organization has demonstrated its capability for detecting and locating infrasonic sources such as meteorites, volcanic eruptions, earthquakes, auroras, mountain associated waves... Nearly 70% of the global network is now operational and regional cluster arrays are deployed around the globe. Systematic investigations into low-frequency acoustic signals have evidenced an unprecedented potential of the monitoring of infrasonic waves permanently generated by natural and man-made events. Furthermore, recent studies point out new insights on quantitative relationships between observables and atmospheric specifications, and therefore opening new fields into the mathematics of geophysical inverse problems for atmospheric remote sensing. This volume reviews the most important areas of infrasound, with emphasis on the latest researches and applications, e.g. instrumentation, engineering, signal processing, source monitoring, propagation modeling, atmospheric dynamics, global changes, remote sensing methods. Researchers and students will benefit from a comprehensive content of infrasound related topics, where both fundamental and applied topics are discussed by authors from international institutions, all experts in their fields.","2010-01-19","http://books.google.es/books?id=lXdPbCEkV9sC&pg=PA224&dq=hazard+%2B+network&hl=&cd=37&source=gbs_api","1402095082",
"Minority Citizens in Disasters","hazard + network","[Ronald W. Perry, Alvin H.

Ronald Perry and Alvin Mushkatel find that response to initial warnings is influenced by the source of the information--mass media, public authorities, or family and friends--and by the immediacy of the danger, a group's familiarity with the type of threat, and the cause of the disaster. Though social contacts were most often the source of warning, public authorities were the most trusted and reliable. The mass media, usually considered an unreliable source, proved an effective means for reaching a majority of Mexican-Americans, who often tuned in to Spanish-language stations. Blacks, however, tended to dismiss the media as a vehicle controlled by whites and covering primarily white concerns, while whites often dismissed news stories as mere media productions. Perry and Mushkatel's record of the responses of blacks, Mexican-Americans, and whites not only reveals the differing social configurations of minority and majority groups but, more important, suggests concrete ways to modify and improve emergency management systems.","2008-03-01","http://books.google.es/books?id=3lMgmiFavd0C&pg=PA112&dq=hazard+%2B+network&hl=&cd=38&source=gbs_api","9780820331416",
"Natural Hazard Mitigation.

While natural hazards cannot be prevented, their human impacts can be greatly reduced through advance action that mitigates risks and reduces vulnerability.Natural Hazard Mitigation describes and analyzes the way that hazard mitigation has been carried out in the U.S. under our national disaster law, the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act. It is the first systematic study of the complete intergovernmental system for natural hazard mitigation, including its major elements and the linkages among them.The book: analyzes the effectiveness of the Stafford Act and investigates what is contained in state hazard mitigation plans required by the Act studies how federal hazard mitigation funds have been spent explores what goes into decision making following a major disaster looks at how government mitigation officials rate the effectiveness of the mitigation system suggests changes that could help solve the widely recognized problems with current methods of coping with disasters.Damages from natural disasters are reaching catastrophic proportions, making natural hazard mitigation an important national policy issue. The findings and recommendations presented in this volume should help to strengthen natural hazard mitigation policy and practice, thereby serving to reduce drains on the federal treasury that pay for preventable recovery and relief costs, and to spare residents in areas hit by natural disasters undue suffering and expense. It is an informative and eye-opening study for planners, policymakers, students of planning and geography, and professionals working for government agencies that deal with natural hazards.","1999","http://books.google.es/books?id=WN_RgufVR6YC&pg=PA195&dq=hazard+%2B+network&hl=&cd=40&source=gbs_api","1559636025",

The optimum theoretical treatment of RF suppression deals with the minimum of parameters and involves the minimum of mathematical difficulty. This report presents a method of analysis consistent with these goals. Simple formulas are given for computing insertion loss with a generator of known characteristics, and for computing the minimum insertion loss with a generator of variable or unknown characteristics.

"Disaster Resilience. A National Imperative","hazard + networks","[Committee on Increasing National Resilience to Hazards and Disasters, Committee on Science, Engineering, and Public Policy, Policy and Global Affairs, The National Academies]","[Nature]","No person or place is immune from disasters or disaster-related losses. Infectious disease outbreaks, acts of terrorism, social unrest, or financial disasters in addition to natural hazards can all lead to large-scale consequences for the nation and its communities. Communities and the nation thus face difficult fiscal, social, cultural, and environmental choices about the best ways to ensure basic security and quality of life against hazards, deliberate attacks, and disasters. Beyond the unquantifiable costs of injury and loss of life from disasters, statistics for 2011 alone indicate economic damages from natural disasters in the United States exceeded $55 billion, with 14 events costing more than a billion dollars in damages each. One way to reduce the impacts of disasters on the nation and its communities is to invest in enhancing resilience--the ability to prepare and plan for, absorb, recover from and more successfully adapt to adverse events. Disaster Resilience: A National Imperative addresses the broad issue of increasing the nation's resilience to disasters. This book defines ""national resilience"", describes the state of knowledge about resilience to hazards and disasters, and frames the main issues related to increasing resilience in the United States. It also provide goals, baseline conditions, or performance metrics for national resilience and outlines additional information, data, gaps, and/or obstacles that need to be addressed to increase the nation's resilience to disasters. Additionally, the book's authoring committee makes recommendations about the necessary approaches to elevate national resilience to disasters in the United States. Enhanced resilience allows better anticipation of disasters and better planning to reduce disaster losses-rather than waiting for an event to occur and paying for it afterward. Disaster Resilience confronts the topic of how to increase the nation's resilience to disasters through a vision of the characteristics of a resilient nation in the year 2030. Increasing disaster resilience is an imperative that requires the collective will of the nation and its communities. Although disasters will continue to occur, actions that move the nation from reactive approaches to disasters to a proactive stance where communities actively engage in enhancing resilience will reduce many of the broad societal and economic burdens that disasters can cause.","2012-12-13","http://books.google.es/books?id=tWN0AAAAQBAJ&pg=PA47&dq=hazard+%2B+networks&hl=&cd=5&source=gbs_api","9780309261517",

"Flow Networks. Analysis and optimization of repairable flow networks, networks with disturbed flows, static flow networks and reliability networks","hazard + networks","[Michael T. Todinov]","[Technology & Engineering]","Repairable flow networks are a new area of research, which analyzes the repair and flow disruption caused by failures of components in static flow networks. This book addresses a gap in current network research by developing the theory, algorithms and applications related to repairable flow networks and networks with disturbed flows. The theoretical results presented in the book lay the foundations of a new generation of ultra-fast algorithms for optimizing the flow in networks after failures or congestion, and the high computational speed creates the powerful possibility of optimal control of very large and complex networks in real time. Furthermore, the possibility for re-optimizing the network flows in real time increases significantly the yield from real production networks and reduces to a minimum the flow disruption caused by failures. The potential application of repairable flow networks reaches across many large and complex systems, including active power networks, telecommunication networks, oil and gas production networks, transportation networks, water supply networks, emergency evacuation networks, and supply networks. The book reveals a fundamental flaw in classical algorithms for maximising the throughput flow in networks, published since the creation of the theory of flow networks in 1956. Despite the years of intensive research, the classical algorithms for maximising the throughput flow leave highly undesirable directed loops of flow in the optimised networks. These flow loops are associated with wastage of energy and resources and increased levels of congestion in the optimised networks.

Presenting an up-to-date look at the changing nature of disasters, Natural Hazard Mitigation offers practical guidance on the implementation and selection of hazard mitigation programs and projects. Based on real-world applications, the book includes case studies that present a thorough explanation of the various issues involved. The contributors describe the value and potential of mitigation efforts and explain how to convince public officials and communities of that value. They also discuss how to better involve the community and uniquely tailor solutions to regional and local situations. The book begins with an overview of the history of hazard mitigation with a focus on the Disaster Mitigation Act of 2000. It examines where hazard mitigation fits into emergency management and addresses some of the challenges that can arise in navigating the various intergovernmental relationships involved in hazard mitigation. The remaining chapters explore: Public-private partnerships for hazard mitigation at the local level The role currently played by the private sector and how communities can best make use of contractors How to maximize the use of the National Flood Insurance Program and the Community Ratings System Risk communications as a key component of encouraging hazard mitigation Legal issues relevant to hazard mitigation Ways to actively engage the community and how to advocate for hazard mitigation policy How state and local governments can promote and fund mitigation without utilizing federal dollars The challenges associated with volunteers and how to best make use of this resource The area analysis as an innovative means of addressing flood risk at the block or neighborhood level The book includes learning objectives, key terms, and end-of-chapter questions to enhance comprehension. It concludes with a discussion of tools that local practitioners can use and provides an appendix with additional links and resources. This volume is an essential reference for both students and professionals in the ongoing effort to better prepare communities against the effects of natural hazards.","2012-11-26","http://books.google.es/books?id=E_hXvhfwfAEC&pg=PA165&dq=hazard+%2B+networks&hl=&cd=24&source=gbs_api","9781439834930",

"Agency, Education and Networks:","hazard + networks","[Guy Stecklov]","[Anthropology]","Abstract: This paper examines the causes and dynamics of the shift in the gender composition of migration, and more particularly, in the access of women to migration opportunities and decision making. The context of the analysis is Albania, a natural laboratory for studying migration developments given that out-migration was practically eliminated from the end of World War II to the end of the 1980s. The authors use micro-level data from the Albania 2005 Living Standards Measurement Study including migration histories for family members since migration began. Based on discrete-time hazard models, the analysis shows an impressive expansion of female participation in international migration. Female migration, which is shown to be strongly associated with education, wealth, and social capital, appears responsive to economic incentives and constraints. Yet, using unique data on the dependency of female migration to the household demographic structure as well as the sensitivity of female migration to household-level shocks, the authors show that it is the households themselves that are the decision-making agents behind this economic calculus and there is little to suggest that increased female migration signals the emergence of female agency.","2008","http://books.google.es/books?id=RDy5bB63tYQC&pg=PA11&dq=hazard+%2B+networks&hl=&cd=34&source=gbs_api","Agency, Education a",

"Planning for Coastal Resilience. Best Practices for Calamitous Times","hazard + networked","[Timothy Beatley]","[Architecture]","Climate change is predicted to increase the frequency and magnitude of coastal storms around the globe, and the anticipated rise of sea levels will have enormous impact on fragile and vulnerable coastal regions. In the U.S., more than 50% of the population inhabits coastal areas. In Planning for Coastal Resilience, Tim Beatley argues that, in the face of such threats, all future coastal planning and management must reflect a commitment to the concept of resilience. In this timely book, he writes that coastal resilience must become the primary design and planning principle to guide all future development and all future infrastructure decisions. Resilience, Beatley explains, is a profoundly new way of viewing coastal infrastructure—an approach that values smaller, decentralized kinds of energy, water, and transport more suited to the serious physical conditions coastal communities will likely face. Implicit in the notion is an emphasis on taking steps to build adaptive capacity, to be ready ahead of a crisis or disaster. It is anticipatory, conscious, and intentional in its outlook. After defining and explaining coastal resilience, Beatley focuses on what it means in practice. Resilience goes beyond reactive steps to prevent or handle a disaster. It takes a holistic approach to what makes a community resilient, including such factors as social capital and sense of place. Beatley provides case studies of five U.S. coastal communities, and “resilience profiles” of six North American communities, to suggest best practices and to propose guidelines for increasing resilience in threatened communities.","2009-07-10","http://books.google.es/books?id=8aNnNgWpU14C&pg=PA4&dq=hazard+%2B+networked&hl=&cd=14&source=gbs_api","1610911423",

"Disaster Resilience. An Integrated Approach","hazard + networked","[Douglas Paton, David Moore Johnston]","[Social Science]","This book will fill the gaps that hamper the effective utilization of the resilience and sustainability concepts within emergency planning: one concerns the lack of a comprehensive review of this multi-level concept; the second relates to its multi-level nature. Specifically, the text identifies a need for the systematic integration of these different levels in a manner that illustrates the holistic contribution of the resilience concept to emergency planning. By integrating these different levels in a manner that illustrates the holistic contribution of the resilience concept to emergency planning, a comprehensive working model of disaster resilience and sustainability can be developed. The text discusses the resources and strategies required at each level to facilitate resilience and how they can be integrated to develop a sustained capacity to adapt to nature (and other) hazard consequences. The nature and implications of these inter-relationships will be developed throughout the text and will lead towards the development of a comprehensive, integrated model of community resilience. A key focus of the text will thus be its articulating the inter-relationships between these levels. The importance of basing emergency planning on the holistic application of the concept will also be discussed. By representing resilience in a holistic manner, the text will also constitute a resource capable of assisting assessment of the community implications of any shortfall of resilience resources for emergency planning and for community recovery planning. The book brings together contributions from international experts in core areas. It includes chapters that provide an overarching framework within which the need for inter-relationships between levels to be developed is discussed. It also includes sections that link chapters to progressively develop a holistic multi-level model, and a chapter that describes the final comprehensive model and its implications for contemporary emergency management. It will be useful to those researching or teaching courses in emergency management, disaster management, community development, environmental planning, urban development, sociology, and applied psychology, as well as to emergency management agencies, risk management agencies, engineers and consultants, planners, emergency and law enforcement agencies, and social and welfare agencies.","2006-01-01","http://books.google.es/books?id=B-1VGNdM8lkC&pg=PA77&dq=hazard+%2B+networked&hl=&cd=20&source=gbs_api","9780398076634",

It situates the operation within the context of the AFSC's attempts to exercise new influence on the separate issues of pacifism and disarmament at a time marked by US efforts to construct a Cold War security regime in the Middle East and British efforts to retain influence and bases in Arab countries. Using archival data, oral histories, diplomatic documents, and biographical and autobiographical accounts, the authors provide a detailed look at internal decision-making in an early non-governmental organization where beliefs regarding the requirement to provide refugees with skills for self-reliance clashed with intractable political and cultural realities and the realization that only full repatriation or resettlement elsewhere would solve the problem (a lesson that UNRWA and the international community learned only decades later). Faced with impossible solutions, the Quakers withdrew. The story of AFSC involvement in Gaza shows that refugee relief is always political and that humanitarianism can prolong the problems it seeks to solve.","2013-12-18","http://books.google.es/books?id=TSSuAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA171&dq=hazard+%2B+networked&hl=&cd=23&source=gbs_api","9781137378170",

"Integrating Ecology and Poverty Reduction. Ecological Dimensions","hazard + ecosystem","[Jane Carter Ingram, Fabrice DeClerck, Cristina Rumbaitis del Rio]","[Business & Economics]","In the past, the science of ecology has frequently been excluded from the development agenda for various reasons. Increasingly however there has been a renewed interest in finding more ecologically sustainable means of development that have required a strong foundation in ecological knowledge (for example EcoAgriculture Partnerships, EcoHealth presented at ESA, and EcoNutrition proposed by Deckelbaum et al). Each of these examples has already taken the critical first step at integrating ecological knowledge with agriculture, health and nutrition, respectively. However, this is only the first step; more attention needs to be placed not only on the role that two fields can play towards poverty alleviation, but on the role of a truly integrated, interdisciplinary approach towards development goals that is firmly grounded in ecological understanding. We feel that a critical look at what ecology can and cannot provide to the development agenda, in light of the Millennium Development goals, is timely and crucial. The introduction and the final section of the book will then integrate the lessons and principles outlined in each of the chapters. All chapter authors will be heavily encouraged to focus on how their sub-discipline in ecology impacts overall human well-being and environmental sustainability.","2012-02-15","http://books.google.es/books?id=HAf3i_5bquAC&pg=PA381&dq=hazard+%2B+ecosystem&hl=&cd=12&source=gbs_api","9781441906335",

As a result, the scope of environmental studies is growing and the methods are evolving. Integrated Assessment of Ecosystem Health aggressively broadens the range of ecotoxicology to include its related fields. The book begins with John Cairns, Jr.'s predictions and recommendations for the future ecotoxicology: ""New goals must lead to new techniques.... the field of ecotoxicology is in the early stages of a major paradigm shift that is driven by three interrelated forces: 1) heightened interest in sustainable use of the planet, 2) protection of ecosystem , and 3) the shift from emphasis on avoiding deleterious effects to maintaining them in robust health."" Later chapters explore the integration of data, intrinsic remediation studies and the ever- increasing number of associated disciplines that are improving our environmental potential. Methodology, itself, is considered as an evolving tool, always in need examination and revision. Cairns, and his co-authors all advocate a constructive, offensive new form of ecoscience. The consensus of scientists is clear: toxic threat and, especially, habitat destruction are the most important environmentl issues, today. The mandate from Integrated Assessment of Ecosystem Health is also decisive: expand the parameters of ecoscience. The future of life on earth depends upon our ability to grow and learn.","1999-10-12","http://books.google.es/books?id=JOz8aohKpQkC&pg=PA273&dq=hazard+%2B+ecosystem&hl=&cd=16&source=gbs_api","1566704537",

"Ecology, Engineering, and Management. Reconciling Ecosystem Rehabilitation and Service Reliability","hazard + ecosystem","[Michel van Eeten, Emery Roe]","[Political Science]","Ecology, Engineering, and the Paradox of Management is the first book that addresses and reconciles what many take to be the core paradox facing environmental decision-makers and stakeholders: How do they restore the environment while at the same time provide ever more services reliably from that environment, including clean air, water and energy for more and more people? The book provides a conceptual framework, empirical case analyses, and organizational proposals to resolve the paradox, be it in the US, Europe, or elsewhere. Thus, Ecology, Engineering, and the Paradox of Management has multiple audiences. First are the key professions involved in the protection and improvement of ecosystems and in the provision and delivery of services from those ecosystems. These include ecologists (and other natural scientists such as conservation biologists, climatologists, forest scientists, and toxicologists), engineers (as well as hydrologists, environmental engineers, civil engineers, and line operators), modeling and gaming experts, managers, planners, and power, agriculture, and recreation communities. Another audience includes university researchers in ecology, conservation biology, engineering, the policy sciences, and resource management. Those interested in interdisciplinary approaches in these fields will also find the book especially helpful. Finally, those interested in the Everglades, the Columbia River Basin, San Francisco Bay-Delta, and the Green Heart of western Netherlands will find new insights here, as the book provides a detailed examination of the paradox in each of these cases.","2002","http://books.google.es/books?id=-8TlX3d4Qv4C&pg=PA99&dq=hazard+%2B+ecosystem&hl=&cd=30&source=gbs_api","0195139682",

Interim Report","hazard + ecosystem","[Committee on the Effects of the Deepwater Horizon Mississippi Canyon-252 Oil Spill on Ecosystem Services in the Gulf of Mexico, Ocean Studies Board, Division on Earth and Life Studies, National Research Council]","[Science]","On April 20, 2010, the Deepwater Horizon platform drilling the Macondo well in Mississippi Canyon Block 252 (DWH) exploded, killing 11 workers and injuring another 17. The DWH oil spill resulted in nearly 5 million barrels (approximately 200 million gallons) of crude oil spilling into the Gulf of Mexico (GoM). The full impacts of the spill on the GoM and the people who live and work there are unknown but expected to be considerable, and will be expressed over years to decades. In the short term, up to 80,000 square miles of the U.S. Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) were closed to fishing, resulting in loss of food, jobs and recreation. The DWH oil spill immediately triggered a process under the U.S. Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (OPA) to determine the extent and severity of the ""injury"" (defined as an observable or measurable adverse change in a natural resource or impairment of a natural resource service) to the public trust, known as the Natural Resources Damage Assessment (NRDA). The assessment, undertaken by the trustees (designated technical experts who act on behalf of the public and who are tasked with assessing the nature and extent of site-related contamination and impacts), requires: (1) quantifying the extent of damage; (2) developing, implementing, and monitoring restoration plans; and (3) seeking compensation for the costs of assessment and restoration from those deemed responsible for the injury. This interim report provides options for expanding the current effort to include the analysis of ecosystem services to help address the unprecedented scale of this spill in U.S. waters and the challenges it presents to those charged with undertaking the damage assessment.","2012-03-02","http://books.google.es/books?id=QBTMHhGefJ8C&pg=PA97&dq=hazard+%2B+ecosystem&hl=&cd=32&source=gbs_api","9780309211796",

Analyzing these geographically separate but ecologically convergent ecosystems provides key tools for understanding fire regime diversity and its role in the assembly and evolutionary convergence of ecosystems. Topics covered include regional patterns, the ecological role of wildfires, the evolution of species within those systems, and the ways in which societies have adapted to living in fire-prone environments. Outlining complex processes clearly and methodically, the discussion challenges the belief that climate and soils alone can explain the global distribution and assembly of plant communities. An ideal research tool for graduates and researchers, this study provides valuable insights into fire management and the requirements for regionally tailored approaches to fire management across the globe.","2011-12-30","http://books.google.es/books?id=5jsgAwAAQBAJ&pg=PA362&dq=hazard+%2B+ecosystems&hl=&cd=10&source=gbs_api","9781107376991",
"Sustainability and Diversity of Forest Ecosystems. An Interdisciplinary Approach","hazard + ecosystems","[Tohru Nakashizuka]","[Nature]","Biodiversity is decreasing at the fastest rate in the history of the earth, largely as a result of human activity. The sustainable use of ecosystems allowing maintenance of biological diversity is an urgent problem that must be solved. Among terrestrial ecosystems, forests support the richest biological diversity. The interaction of humans and forests has a long history, but recent changes have been the most drastic ever. The rapid decrease and deterioration of forest ecosystems has been caused by social, economic, and ecological factors, which may vary locally but are common globally. The mechanisms causing biodiversity loss through forest utilization and the results of that loss of biodiversity are still virtually unknown, although such knowledge is crucial to developing sustainable management strategies. The work featured in this book presents the results achieved by the RIHN project, together with reports on other international activities and related efforts, as ecologists, forestry scientists, environmental economists, and sociologists share in discussions of the issues.","2009-03-12","http://books.google.es/books?id=J3eQA3UWj40C&pg=PA436&dq=hazard+%2B+ecosystems&hl=&cd=11&source=gbs_api","4431732381",

"Design for Human Ecosystems. Landscape, Land Use, and Natural Resources","hazard + ecosystems","[John Lyle]","[Nature]","For more than 30 years, John Tillman Lyle (1934-1998) was one of the leading thinkers in the field of ecological design. Design for Human Ecosystems, originally published in 1985, is his classic text that explores methods of designing landscapes that function in the sustainable ways of natural ecosystems. The book provides a framework for thinking about and understanding ecological design, along with a wealth of real-world examples that bring to life Lyle's key ideas. Lyle traces the historical growth of design approaches involving natural processes, and presents an introduction to the principles, methods, and techniques that can be used to shape landscape, land use, and natural resources in an ecologically sensitive and sustainable manner. Lyle argues that careful design of human ecosystems recognizes three fundamental concerns: scale (the relative size of the landscape and its connections with larger and smaller systems), the design process itself, and the underlying order that binds ecosystems together and makes them work. He discusses the importance of each of these concerns, and presents a workable approach to designing systems that effectively accounts for all of them. The theory presented is supported throughout by numerous case studies that illustrate its practical applications. This new edition features a foreword by Joan Woodward, noted landscape architecture professor and colleague of Lyle, that places the book in the context of current ecological design thinking and discusses Lyle's contributions to the field. It will be a valuable resource for landscape architects, planners, students of ecological design, and anyone interested in creating landscapes that meet the needs of all an area's inhabitants -- human and nonhuman alike.","1999-03-01","http://books.google.es/books?id=sFL0rI2gmHsC&pg=PA252&dq=hazard+%2B+ecosystems&hl=&cd=20&source=gbs_api","9781610912600",
"Drought and Aquatic Ecosystems. Effects and Responses","hazard + ecosystems","[P. Sam Lake]","[Science]","Droughts are a major hazard to both natural and human-dominated environments and those, especially of long duration and high intensity, can be highly damaging and leave long-lasting effects. This book describes the climatic conditions that give rise to droughts, and their various forms and chief attributes. Past droughts are described including those that had severe impacts on human societies. As a disturbance, droughts can be thought of as “ramps” in that they usually build slowly and take time to become evident. As precipitation is reduced, flows from catchments into aquatic systems decline. As water declines in water bodies, ecological processes are changed and the biota can be drastically reduced, though species and populations may survive by using refuges. Recovery from drought varies in both rates and in degrees of completeness and may be a function of both refuge availability and connectivity. For the first time, this book reviews the available rather scattered literature on the impacts of drought on the flora, fauna and ecological processes of aquatic ecosystems ranging from small ponds to lakes and from streams to estuaries. The effects of drought on the biota of standing waters and flowing waters and of temporary waters and perennial systems are described and compared. In addition, the ways in which human activity can exacerbate droughts are outlined. In many parts of the world especially in the mid latitudes, global warming may result in increases in the duration and intensity of droughts. Drought and Aquatic Ecosystems is essential reading for freshwater ecologists, water resource managers and advanced students.","2011-05-12","http://books.google.es/books?id=QieHNTcYZtYC&pg=PA3&dq=hazard+%2B+ecosystems&hl=&cd=21&source=gbs_api","9781444341782",
"Biological Effects of Surfactants","hazard + ecosystems","[S.A. Ostroumov]","[Technology & Engineering]","Understanding the role of aquatic biota and the impact of pollution and chemical substances that enter aquatic ecosystems is crucial to the assessment, prevention, and remediation of damaged environments. Biological Effects of Surfactants synthesizes the most important findings from hundreds of articles and the author's current experiments on the biological effects of synthetic surfactants and detergents on individual organisms, populations, communities, and ecosystems. This book offers a new perspective of the hazards of pollution. The book draws upon concepts in hydrobiology, biogeochemical cycling, and the assimilative capacity of water-beyond the self-purification capabilities of bacteria and nutrient cycling-to examine the effects of anionic, non-ionic, and cationic surfactants as well as detergent mixtures on a wide range of organisms including bacteria, cyanobacteria, flagellates, algae, higher plants, and invertebrates. The author, a distinguished member of the Russian Academy of Natural Sciences, establishes new quantitative characteristics of the effects and presents study results reflecting newly discovered phenomena. While proposing and substantiating new priorities and approaches for testing, assessing, and characterizing the biological activities and hazards of substances, he illustrates how the data obtained can be used to develop effective environmental remediation and protection measures to improve water quality. Biological Effects of Surfactants lays an excellent foundation for scientists to explore how hazardous wastes are absorbed in aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems, determine what is required for remediation and restoring water quality, and design the best approach to counteract the toxic effects of manmade surfactants using biological methods, including phytoremediation.","2010-12-12","http://books.google.es/books?id=prERdufIXg4C&pg=PA197&dq=hazard+%2B+ecosystems&hl=&cd=22&source=gbs_api","142002129X",

"Assessment of Effects of Chemical Contaminants in Dredged Material on Marine Ecosystems and Human Health","hazard + ecosystems","[Cor Schipper]","[Science]","This volume explores the applicability of bioassays and bioindicators as tools for evaluating the effects of dredged sediments on the marine ecosystem. Waterways and harbors in delta areas must be dredged regularly to remove sediments which might otherwise block shipping routes, and hundreds of millions of tonnes of sediment are removed each year worldwide. Besides containing a relatively high amount of organic matter, these sediments also contain a complex mixture of chemicals, many of which are toxic to some degree. These cocktails of compounds in dredged material, and their effects on the environment, are as yet inadequately measured and assessed. One approach to identifying the toxicity of the mixture of unmeasured chemicals present in dredged material is by effect-based bioassays, quantifying the effect of a whole mixture rather than that of each compound. This study analyses the application of bioassays and develops a rationale for their inclusion in hazard, risk and impact assessment of dredged sediments. It also establishes a comprehensive set of bioassays and markers to assist this process. Aspects covered include: the predictability of in vitro and in vivo bioassays and markers, the applicability of the DR-CALUX bioassay in the licensing system, the optimization of an in vivo bioassay with cultured heart urchins (E.cordatum) and a site-specific assessment of TBT originating from anti-fouling paint in marine and harbor sediments. This book is an important contribution to the improved understanding vital to minimize the risks associated with the disposal of dredged materials.","2009","http://books.google.es/books?id=XBOFr9NK9bAC&pg=PA120&dq=hazard+%2B+ecosystems&hl=&cd=28&source=gbs_api","9781607500858",
"Collaborative Resilience. Moving Through Crisis to Opportunity","hazard + ecosystems","[Bruce Evan Goldstein]","[Architecture]","Crisis--whether natural disaster, technological failure, economic collapse, or shocking acts of violence--can offer opportunities for collaboration, consensus building, and transformative social change. Communities often experience a surge of collective energy and purpose in the aftermath of crisis. Rather than rely on government and private-sector efforts to deal with crises through prevention and mitigation, we can harness post-crisis forces for recovery and change through innovative collaborative planning. Drawing on recent work in the fields of planning and natural resource management, this book examines a range of efforts to enhance resilience through collaboration, describing communities that have survived and even thrived by building trust and interdependence. These collaborative efforts include environmental assessment methods in Cozumel, Mexico; the governance of a ""climate protected community"" in the Blackfoot Valley of Montana; fisheries management in Southeast Asia's Mekong region; and the restoration of natural fire regimes in U.S. forests. In addition to describing the many forms that collaboration can take--including consensus processes, learning networks, and truth and reconciliation commissions--the authors argue that collaborative resilience requires redefining the idea of resilience itself. A resilient system is not just discovered through good science; it emerges as a community debates and defines ecological and social features of the system and appropriate scales of activity. Poised between collaborative practice and resilience analysis, collaborative resilience is both a process and an outcome of collective engagement with social-ecological complexity.","2012","http://books.google.es/books?id=aGos8x0fPPoC&pg=PA155&dq=hazard+%2B+ecosystems&hl=&cd=30&source=gbs_api","9780262516457",
