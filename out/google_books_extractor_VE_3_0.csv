"Credit Risk Management: Basic Concepts: Financial Risk Components, Rating Analysis, Models, Economic and Regulatory Capital","intitle:risk","[Tony Van Gestel, Bart Baesens]","[Business & Economics]","Credit Risk Management: Basic Concepts is the first book of a series of three with the objective of providing an overview of all aspects, steps, and issues that should be considered when undertaking credit risk management, including the Basel II Capital Accord, which all major banks must comply with in 2008. The introduction of the recently suggested Basel II Capital Accord has raised many issues and concerns about how to appropriately manage credit risk. Managing credit risk is one of the next big challenges facing financial institutions. The importance and relevance of efficiently managing credit risk is evident from the huge investments that many financial institutions are making in this area, the booming credit industry in emerging economies (e.g. Brazil, China, India, ...), the many events (courses, seminars, workshops, ...) that are being organised on this topic, and the emergence of new academic journals and magazines in the field (e.g. Journal of Credit Risk, Journal of Risk Model Validation, Journal of Risk Management in Financial Institutions, ...). Basic Concepts provides the introduction to the concepts, techniques, and practical examples to guide both young and experienced practitioners and academics in the fascinating, but complex world of risk modelling. Financial risk management, an area of increasing importance with the recent Basel II developments, is discussed in terms of practical business impact and the increasing profitability competition, laying the foundation for books II and III.","2008-10-23","http://books.google.es/books?id=aXP7xjN5o00C&printsec=frontcover&dq=intitle:risk&hl=&cd=17&source=gbs_api","0191609307",

"Risk Perceptions, Risk Preferences, Risk Ambiguity, and Flood Insurance","intitle:risk",,"[Flood insurance]","This thesis presents an analysis of subjective risk information and participation in the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP). Data are taken from a survey of residents in flood-prone coastal regions in the southeastern U.S. Regression models are constructed to better understand factors affecting individuals' perceived risk ambiguity related to flood risk and the role of risk preferences, risk perceptions, and especially risk ambiguity, on the decision to purchase flood insurance. This is the first study not only of the influence of risk ambiguity on NFIP participation, but also of the impact of using different risk perception measures. Results indicate that NFIP participation is significantly affected by mean perceived risk, but the influence of range/variance of perceived risk, which presents one's perceived ambiguity, is mixed.","2012","http://books.google.es/books?id=xJk-nQEACAAJ&dq=intitle:risk&hl=&cd=40&source=gbs_api","OCLC:806515412",

"An Analysis of Transfer Risk in Comparison to Sovereign Risk","intitle:risk","[Philipp Hauger]","[Business & Economics]","Transfer risk is the risk that a non-sovereign entity, which is able and willing to service its foreign currency obligations, cannot obtain the required currency or cannot transfer this money to the receiver abroad. This transfer inability is caused by the imposition of restrictions on convertibility or capital transfers by the government. Transfer risk applies to all types of international investments, especially in emerging market countries. Due to this, it is more important than ever in these days of globalization. The New Basel Capital Accords require the consideration of transfer risk, too. The author Philipp Hauger describes the different types of risk occurring in international borrowings and investments. The political and corporate determinants of transfer risk are examined. The book illustrates the reasons why monetary unions reduce the risk of a transfer event, even though they have no influence on the sovereign risk. In addition, the author details how transfer risk is assessed by international professionals and describes two interesting approaches to estimate transfer risk in a quantitative way. This book is intended for professionals and students who are interested in the risks of international investments and for everybody working in international business, who has to differentiate between sovereign risk and the risk of a corporate default.","2006-10-21","http://books.google.es/books?id=l0NPQM46vFIC&printsec=frontcover&dq=intitle:risk&hl=&cd=65&source=gbs_api","9783638559454",

"RISK VS. RISK","intitle:risk","[John D. GRAHAM, Jonathan Baert Wiener]","[Medical]","We see the stories in the newspaper nearly every day: a drug hailed as a breakthrough treatment turns out to cause harmful side effects; controls implemented to reduce air pollution are shown to generate hazardous solid waste; bans on dangerous chemicals result in the introduction of even more risky substitutes. Could our efforts to protect our health and the environment actually be making things worse? This suspicion has long troubled both advocates and critics of risk-reduction efforts, but the problem has never received focused scrutiny. In Risk vs. Risk, John D. Graham, Jonathan Baert Wiener, and their colleagues at the Harvard Center for Risk Analysis marshal an impressive set of case studies which demonstrate that all too often our nation's campaign to reduce risks to our health and the environment is at war with itself, steadily creating new risks. At the heart of this volume is a set of nine case studies illustrating the complexities of risk tradeoffs, ranging from personal medical choices to control of toxic substances to prevention of global crises. In each case, authors with specific expertise in the field dissect the multidimensional risk consequences of choices facing decision makers. Some of these cases reveal utter folly in risk-reduction efforts; others show decision makers recognizing and dealing with risk tradeoffs.","1995","http://books.google.es/books?id=SdjmWw5baDoC&printsec=frontcover&dq=intitle:risk&hl=&cd=73&source=gbs_api","0674773047",

"Measuring Market Risk with Value at Risk","intitle:risk","[Pietro Penza, Vipul K. Bansal]","[Business & Economics]","""This book, Measuring Market Risk with Value at Risk by Vipul Bansal and Pietro Penza, has three advantages over earlier works on the subject. First, it takes a decidedly global approach-an essential ingredient for any comprehensive work on market risk. Second, it ties the scientifically grounded, yet intuitively appealing, VaR measure to earlier, more idiosyncratic measures of market risk that are used in specific market environs (e.g., duration in fixed income). Finally, it encompasses all of the accepted approaches to calculating a VaR measure and presents them in a clearly explained fashion with supporting illustrations and completely worked-out examples."" -from the Foreword by John F. Marshall, PhD, Principal, Marshall, Tucker & Associates, LLC ""Measuring Market Risk with Value at Risk offers a much-needed intellectual bridge, a translation from the esoteric realm of mathematical finance to the domain of financial managers who seek guidance in applying developments from this important field of research as well as that of MBA-level graduate instruction. I believe the authors have done a commendable job of providing a carefully crafted, highly readable, and most useful work, and intend to recommend it to all those involved in business risk management applications."" -Anthony F. Herbst, PhD, Professor of Finance and C.R. and D.S. Carter Chair, The University of Texas, El Paso and Founding editor of The Journal of Financial Engineering (1991-1998) ""Finally there's a book that strikes a balance between rigor and application in the area of risk management in the banking industry. This innovative book is a MUST for both novices and professionals alike."" -Robert P. Yuyuenyongwatana, PhD, Associate Professor of Finance, Cameron University ""Measuring Market Risk with Value at Risk is one of the most complete discussions of this emerging topic in finance that I have seen. The authors develop a logical and rigorous framework for using VaR models, providing both historical references and analytical applications."" -Kevin Wynne, PhD, Associate Professor of Finance, Lubin School of Business, Pace University","2001","http://books.google.es/books?id=ZwH44DRQXLoC&printsec=frontcover&dq=intitle:risk&hl=&cd=78&source=gbs_api","0471393134",
