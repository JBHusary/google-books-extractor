"Market Discipline Under Systemic Risk. Evidence from Bank Runs in Emerging Economies","intitle:market+intitle:systemic","[Eduardo Levy Yeyati, Maria Soledad Martinez Peria, Sergio L. Schmukler]","[Capital market]","""Levy-Yeyati, Martinez Peria, and Schmukler show that systemic risk exerts a significant impact on the behavior of depositors, sometimes overshadowing their responses to standard bank fundamentals. Systemic risk can affect market discipline both regardless of and through bank fundamentals. First, worsening systemic conditions can directly threaten the value of deposits by way of dual agency problems. Second, to the extent that banks are exposed to systemic risk, systemic shocks lead to a future deterioration of fundamentals not captured by their current values. Using data from the recent banking crises in Argentina and Uruguay, the authors show that market discipline is indeed quite robust once systemic risk is factored in. As systemic risk increases, the informational content of past fundamentals declines. These episodes also show how few systemic shocks can trigger a run irrespective of ex-ante fundamentals. Overall, the evidence suggests that in emerging economies, the notion of market discipline needs to account for systemic risk. This paper--a product of the Finance Team, Development Research Group--is part of a larger effort in the group to study market discipline""--World Bank web site.","2004","http://books.google.es/books?id=Cx8z4mvVHYYC&printsec=frontcover&dq=intitle:market%2Bintitle:systemic&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api","Market Discipline U",
"Global Market Conditions and Systemic Risk (EPub)","intitle:market+intitle:systemic","[Heiko Hesse, Brenda González-Hermosillo]",,"This paper examines several key global market conditions, such as a proxy for market uncertainty and measures of interbank funding stress, to assess financial volatility and the likelihood of crisis. Using Markov regime-switching techniques, it shows that the Lehman Brothers failure was a watershed event in the crisis, although signs of heightened systemic risk could be detected as early as February 2007. In addition, we analyze the role of global market conditions to help determine when governments should begin to exit their extraordinary public support measures.","2009-10-01","http://books.google.es/books?id=GoRRw8G1AAYC&printsec=frontcover&dq=intitle:market%2Bintitle:systemic&hl=&cd=2&source=gbs_api","1452786380",

"Collateral, Netting and Systemic Risk in the OTC Derivatives Market (EPub)","intitle:market+intitle:systemic","[Manmohan Singh]",,"To mitigate systemic risk, some regulators have advocated the greater use of centralized counterparties (CCPs) to clear Over-The-Counter (OTC) derivatives trades. Regulators should be cognizant that large banks active in the OTC derivatives market do not hold collateral against all the positions in their trading book and the paper proves an estimate of this under-collateralization. Whatever collateral is held by banks is allowed to be rehypothecated (or re-used) to others. Since CCPs would require all positions to have collateral against them, off-loading a significant portion of OTC derivatives transactions to central counterparties (CCPs) would require large increases in posted collateral, possibly requiring large banks to raise more capital. These costs suggest that most large banks will be reluctant to offload their positions to CCPs, and the paper proposes an appropriate capital levy on remaining positions to encourage the transition.","2010-04-01","http://books.google.es/books?id=JIpd5zMZ__EC&printsec=frontcover&dq=intitle:market%2Bintitle:systemic&hl=&cd=7&source=gbs_api","1452756090",

"Market Structures and Systemic Risks of Exchange-traded Funds","intitle:market+intitle:systemic","[Srichander Ramaswamy]",,"""Crisis experience has shown that as the financial intermediation chain lengthens, it becomes complicated to assess the risks of financial products due to a lack of transparency as to how risks are managed at different levels of the intermediation chain. Exchange-traded funds, which have become popular among investors seeking exposure to a diversified portfolio of assets, share this characteristic, especially when their returns are replicated using derivative products. As the volume of such products grows, such replication strategies can lead to a build-up of systemic risks in the financial system. This article examines the operational frameworks of exchange-traded funds and identifies potential channels through which risks to financial stability can materialise.""--Abstract.","2011","http://books.google.es/books?id=ypTZlAEACAAJ&dq=intitle:market%2Bintitle:systemic&hl=&cd=9&source=gbs_api","OCLC:728059907",

"Two Essays: On the Common Information in the Return Volatilities and Volumes; on the Informational Efficiency of Municipal Bond Market","intitle:market+intitle:bond+intitle:return","[Lei Zhang]","[Information theory in economics]","Essay I provides a financial theoretical model to explain the empirical phenomena that there is a commonality in the return volatilities and the cross-correlation between volatilities and trading volumes of multiple stocks as documented in the literature. I adopt Tauchen and Pitts (1983) bivariate Mixture-of-Distributions Hypothesis (MDH) Model in which stock return and trading volume are both driven by a latent information arrival process. By extending the MDH model to a multiple-stock context and assuming a factor structure in the unobservable information flows, I find that the rank of the correlation matrix of return volatility and volume is the same as the number of common factors underlying information arrivals. In other words, the commonality in the volatility-volume relationship is captured by the commonality in the latent information arrivals. The model is additionally modified by allowing for the dynamics in the common factor underlying the unobserved information flow. The dynamic factor MDH model in a multiple-stock framework accounts for the stylized facts of stock returns such as volatility clustering. A Bayesian estimation procedure of this model is conducted via Bayesian Monte Carlo Markov Chain (MCMC) method. Empirical analysis of DOW15 stocks is provided to illustrate the methodology.","2008","http://books.google.es/books?id=INnNyaVQ76YC&printsec=frontcover&dq=intitle:market%2Bintitle:bond%2Bintitle:return&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api","0549742808",

The chaotic motion inside the plasma as well as the wall patterns, created by open chaotic systems like the DED at TEXTOR, are analyzed. For this, the concept of the stable and unstable manifolds is used. Starting with a basic model, the symmetric tokamap as well as the revtokamap, and continued with a simplified realistic model, the cylindrical DED model, the field line transport is analyzed. The typical structures in open, partially stochastic systems and their connections to the stable and unstable manifolds are explained. Then the cylindrical model is generalized to the real toroidal TEXTOR-DED model. The Hamiltonian for a relativistic guiding-center model is derived and a 4-dimensional mapping procedure is constructed. The drift effects are studied for the unperturbed and the perturbed case. Finally, measurements of heat flux patterns at the divertor plates of the TEXTOR-DED are compared to theoretically calculated ones and their structures are analyzed and explained, using the stable and unstable manifolds.","2009-04-30","http://books.google.es/books?id=XHdnPgAACAAJ&dq=intitle:stable%2Bintitle:chaotic&hl=&cd=4&source=gbs_api","3838106202",

"The Role of Hepatic Nuclear Receptors in Systemic Lipid Homeostasis","intitle:nuclear+intitle:systemic","[Elyisha Anne Hanniman]",,"The nuclear receptor superfamily consists of ligand-activated transcription factors that regulate many genes important in physiological functions such as cellular differentiation as well as glucose and lipid metabolism. Nuclear receptors such as the farnesoid X receptor (FXR) and the liver X receptor function to maintain lipid homeostasis through regulation of genes encoding enzymes, receptors and transporters essential to lipid metabolism. A balance in the intracellular and systemic levels of lipids is crucial for the prevention of diseases such as cholestasis and atherosclerosis. The objectives of this thesis were to examine the role of FXR, a bile acid-activated nuclear receptor, in the regulation of lipid homeostasis and the development of atherosclerosis and to identify and characterize potential novel FXR targets. Through examination, via microarray, northern blot and quantitative PCR, of altered gene expression in various tissues of FXR-deficient mice (FXR-/-) versus wildtype mice, we discovered potential novel targets of this nuclear receptor. Regulatory mechanisms mediating expression of one of the genes altered in FXR-/- mice, apolipoprotein A-IV (apoA-IV), a protein involved in lipid transport and metabolism, were examined using a variety of mouse models and in vitro promoter assays. In addition, through the crossing of FXR-/- mice with a mouse model of atherosclerosis, the apoE-deficient mouse (apoE-/-), we were able to study the effect of deletion of this nuclear receptor on the development of atherosclerotic disease. Our results demonstrate that loss of FXR function leads to a disruption in lipid homeostasis through altered gene expression leading to decreased survival and a worsening of atherosclerosis in the apoE-/- background. In addition, our results describe a regulatory mechanism for apoA-IV involving the nuclear receptor hepatic nuclear factor-4alpha and a coactivator (peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator-1alpha) that, in conjunction with glucocorticolds, induce apoA-IV in response to nutritional and metabolic stresses.","2007","http://books.google.es/books?id=sp1TvjZGMXoC&dq=intitle:nuclear%2Bintitle:systemic&hl=&cd=4&source=gbs_api","0494196149",
