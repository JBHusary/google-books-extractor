Credit default swaps (CDS) are one of the products that have assumed a key role in financial markets. This statement discusses: (1) the extent to which U.S. financial regulators and the UK regulator oversee CDS; (2) risks and challenges that CDS present to the stability of financial markets and institutions and similar concerns that other products may pose; and (3) the recent steps that financial regulators and the industry have taken to address risks pose by CDS and similar efforts that may be warranted for other financial products.

"New Directions for Understanding Systemic Risk. A Report on a Conference Cosponsored by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and the National Academy of Sciences","intitle:risk+intitle:systemic","[National Research Council]","[Business & Economics]","The stability of the financial system and the potential for systemic events to alter its function have long been critical issues for central bankers and researchers. Recent events suggest that older models of systemic shocks might no longer capture all of the possible paths of such disturbances or account for the increasing complexity of the financial system. To help assess these concerns, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and the NRC cosponsored a conference that brought together engineers, scientists, economists, and financial market experts to promote better understanding of systemic risk in a variety of fields. The book presents an examination of tools used in ecology and engineering to study systemic collapse in those areas; a review of current trends in economic research on systemic risk, the payments system, and the market of interbank funds; and for context, descriptions of how systemic risk in the financial system affects trading activities.","2007-12-17","http://books.google.es/books?id=1jGlL5OFf2oC&printsec=frontcover&dq=intitle:risk%2Bintitle:systemic&hl=&cd=4&source=gbs_api","0309107520",
"Globalization And Systemic Risk","intitle:risk+intitle:systemic","[Douglas Darrell Evanoff, David S. Hoelscher, George G. Kaufman]","[Business & Economics]","The impact of globalization of financial markets is a highly debated topic, particularly in recent months when the issue of globalization and contagion of financial distress has become a focus of intense policy debate. The papers in this volume provide an up-to-date overview of the key issues in this debate. While most of the contributions were prepared after the initial outbreak of the current global turmoil and financial crisis, they identify the relative strengths of the risk diversification and risk transmission processes and examine the empirical evidence to date. The book considers the relative roles of banks, nonblank financial institutions and capital markets in both risk diversification and risk transmission. It then evaluates the current status of crisis resolution in a global context, and speculates where to go from here in terms of understanding, resolution, prevention and public policy.

"Uncontrolled Risk: Lessons of Lehman Brothers and How Systemic Risk Can Still Bring Down the World Financial System","intitle:risk+intitle:systemic","[Mark Williams]","[Business & Economics]","How Excessive Risk Destroyed Lehman and Nearly Brought Down the Financial Industry “Uncontrolled Risk will ruffle feathers—and for good reason—as voters and legislators learn the diffi cult lessons of Lehman’s collapse and demand that we never forget them.” Dr. David C. Shimko, Board of Trustees, Global Association of Risk Professionals “Uncontrolled Risk is a drama as gripping as any work of fiction. Williams’s recommendations for changes in the governance of financial institutions should be of interest to anyone concerned about the welfare of global financial markets.” Geoffrey Miller, Stuyvesant Comfort Professor of Law and Director, Center for the Study of Central Banks and Financial Institutions, New York University “The complex balance of free enterprise on Wall Street and the healthy regulation of its participants is the central economic issue of today. Williams’s forensic study of Lehman’s collapse may be the best perspective so far on the issues that now face regulators.” Jeffrey P. Davis, CFA, Chief Investment Officer, Lee Munder Capital Group “Provides a very perceptive analysis of the fl aws inherent in risk management systems and modern fi nancial markets. Mandatory reading for risk managers and financial industry executives.” Vincent Kaminski, Professor in the Practice of Management, Jesse H. Jones Graduate School of Business, Rice University “Gives the reader much food for thought on the regulation of our financial system and its interplay with corporate governance reform in the United States and around the world.” Professor Charles M. Elson, Edgar S. Woolard Jr. Chair in Corporate Governance, University of Delaware The risk taking behind Wall Street's largest bankruptcy . . . In this dramatic and compelling account of Lehman Brothers’ spectacular rise and fall, author Mark T. Williams explains how uncontrolled risk toppled a 158-year-old institution—and what it says about Wall Street, Washington, D.C., and the world financial system. A former trading floor executive and Fed bank examiner, Williams sees Lehman’s 2008 collapse as a microcosm of the industry—a worst-case scenario of smart decisions, stupid mistakes, ignored warnings, and important lessons in money, power, and policy that affect us all. This book reveals: The Congressional inquisition of disgraced CEO Dick Fuld: Did he really deserve it? How the investment-banking money machine broke down: Can it be fixed? The key drivers that caused the financial meltdown: Can lessons be learned from them? The wild risk taking denounced by President Obama: Is Washington to blame, too? The ongoing debate on reform and regulation: Can meaningful reform avert another financial catastrophe? This fascinating account traces Lehman’s history from its humble beginnings in 1850 to its collapse in 2008. Lehman’s story exemplifies the everchanging trends in finance—from investment vehicles to federal policies—and exposes the danger and infectious nature of uncontrolled risk. Drawing upon first-person interviews with risk management experts and former Lehman employees, Williams provides more than just a frontline report: it’s a call to action for Wall Street bankers, Washington policymakers, and U.S. citizens—a living lesson in risk management on which to build a stronger fi nancial future. Williams provides a tenpoint plan to implement today—so another Lehman doesn’t collapse tomorrow. Includes a ten-point plan to ensure a strong financial future for both Wall Street and Main Street","2010-03-22","http://books.google.es/books?id=HSkjB_PGp98C&dq=intitle:risk%2Bintitle:systemic&hl=&cd=9&source=gbs_api","0071638296",

This book explores, in theoretical and empirical terms, the nature of the relationships between the underlying phenomena--levels and changes in debt, vulnerabililty to default in the corporate and household sectors, and systematic risk in the financial sector. The book focuses on the generality of this phenomena--whether similar patterns are observable in certain countries, as well as in the international capital markets themselves. Emphasis is placed to the importance of the nature and evolution of financial structure to the genesis of instability. Given the international scope of the analysis, the work is germane to the study of the development of financial systems in all advanced countries, as well as the euromarkets.","1992","http://books.google.es/books?id=vgCyAAAAIAAJ&dq=intitle:risk%2Bintitle:systemic&hl=&cd=19&source=gbs_api","UCAL:B4355550",

We find a positive trend in stock return correlations net of diversification effects for a sample of U.S. Large and Complex Banking Organizations over 1988-99. This finding suggests that the systemic risk potential in the financial sector may have increased. In addition, we find a positive consolidation elasticity of correlations. However, such elasticity exhibits substantial time variation and likely declined in the latter part of the decade. Thus, factors other than consolidation have also been responsible for the upward trend in return correlations.","2002-03-01","http://books.google.es/books?id=SWNHh_bDOncC&printsec=frontcover&dq=intitle:risk%2Bintitle:systemic&hl=&cd=25&source=gbs_api","1451847637",

This paper examines the causes of delayed depositors' access to their funds at resolved banks, describes how the FDIC provides immediate access, reports on a special survey of access practices in other countries, and analyzes the costs and benefits of delayed access in terms of both the effects on market discipline and depositor pressure to protect all deposits.","2001-06-01","http://books.google.es/books?id=hE9iRCuHWsgC&printsec=frontcover&dq=intitle:risk%2Bintitle:systemic&hl=&cd=26&source=gbs_api","1451850549",

In this paper, systemic risk is defined as the conditional probability of a systemic banking crisis and this conditional probability is modeled in a fixed effect binary response model framework. The model structure is dynamic and is designed for monitoring as the systemic risk forecasts only depend on data that are available in real time. Several risk factors are identified and it is hereby shown that the level of systemic risk contains a predictable component which varies through time. Furthermore, it is shown how the systemic risk forecasts map into crisis signals and how policy thresholds are derived in this framework. Finally, in an out-of-sample exercise, it is shown that the systemic risk estimates provided reliable early warning signals ahead of the recent financial crisis for several economies.","2012-06-01","http://books.google.es/books?id=sbYjwNDjFL4C&printsec=frontcover&dq=intitle:risk%2Bintitle:systemic&hl=&cd=31&source=gbs_api","1475565461",

In particular, we show that carry trade returns are highly correlated with the return of a VIX rolldown strategy -i.e., the strategy of shorting VIX futures and rolling down its term structure- and that the latter strategy performs at least as well as beta-adjusted carry trades, for individual currencies and diversified portfolios. In contrast, hedging the carry with exchange rate options produces large returns that are not a compensation for systemic risk. We show that this result stems from the fact that the corresponding portfolio of exchange rate options provides a cheap form of systemic insurance.","2012","http://books.google.es/books?id=pXm_lAEACAAJ&dq=intitle:risk%2Bintitle:systemic&hl=&cd=37&source=gbs_api","OCLC:822890763",

Given the adverse impact on moral hazard and market discipline, support measures involving public money are ideally limited to crisis situations involving systemic risk: a disturbance in the financial system that is serious enough to affect the real economy.

Upon the arrival of a signal about banks' future defaults, investors update their expectations of bank solvency. If their expectations are low, they do not roll over the debt and there is systemic risk in that all institutions are early liquidated. We compare investors' rollover decisions and welfare in the two networks.","2010","http://books.google.es/books?id=Om82lQEACAAJ&dq=intitle:risk%2Bintitle:systemic&hl=&cd=54&source=gbs_api","OCLC:728275977",

Senior management has to take that information and make a decision, while at the same time recognizing such a decision is going to have a negative effect on revenues.

"Awareness of Increased Risk for Heart Disease and Cardiovascular Risk Factors in Women with Systemic Lupus Erythematosus.","intitle:risk+intitle:systemic","[Patricia K Weinstein]",,"Women with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) develop cardiovascular disease (CVD) earlier and at a more accelerated rate compared to women without SLE. Many women with SLE are unaware of their increased risk despite years spent in the health care system, thus giving the atherogenic process time to accrue damage. Research has not explained fully why women with SLE are unaware of their increased risk for CVD or why awareness does not correspond to risk reducing behaviors. Stage theories of behavior like the Precaution Adoption Process Model (PAPM) propose that health behavior change proceeds through qualitatively different stages, and people at one stage face similar barriers before they can progress to the next. The Common Sense Model (CSM), a self-regulatory model of health behavior, explains the emotional and cognitive processes involved in progression from one stage to the next and the formation of a personal risk/illness representation. Combining the PAPM and CSM helps understand the relationship between risk perception and adoption of risk reducing behaviors. The specific aims of this study were to assess in women with SLE: (1) general knowledge of heart disease compared to women without SLE; (2) awareness of increased CVD risk and CVD risk factors; and (3) personal and healthcare system factors that influence awareness of increased CVD risk and adoption of risk reducing behaviors. Sixty women with SLE, 18 years of age or older, were recruited to participate in this descriptive study. Data included demographic information, self-report questionnaires (perceived CVD risk, CVD risk factors, depression, physical activity), body measures (height, weight, waist circumference, blood pressure), and blood samples for physiologic markers of traditional and novel CVD risk factors (glucose, insulin, lipoprotein lipids, creatinine, C-reactive protein, homocysteine, antiphospholipid antibodies). The Beck Depression Inventory-Primary Care and the Physical Activity Disability Survey were used to determine depression and activity level respectively. General knowledge of heart disease was assessed using the American Heart Association (AHA) National Survey on women's awareness of heart disease. Logistic regression was used to categorize participants into subgroups according to perceived risk and identify important factors that influenced their PAPM stage categorization. Women with SLE in this study were more aware of women's leading cause of death than United States women who responded to the 2006 AHA survey (73% v 57%), but fewer than 25% perceived themselves at increased CVD risk. Age was a significant predictor (p=0.05) for awareness of increased risk; younger age correlated with increased awareness. Most women received information about heart disease from public media. On average, women had 4 CVD risk factors, but they perceived they had only 2. The number of perceived risk factors predicted adoption of risk reducing behaviors (p=0.03). Women in this study with SLE underestimated their CVD risk factors and did not personalize their increased CVD risk. Healthcare providers' identification and discussion of CVD risk factors in women with SLE may enhance their risk awareness and the adoption of risk reducing behaviors. This information may contribute to the development of stage-matched interventions, a potentially more effective and efficient approach than a generic program of risk-reduction, especially in individuals with SLE who face the additional burden of a chronic illness.","2011-09-09","http://books.google.es/books?id=8zVGLgEACAAJ&dq=intitle:risk%2Bintitle:systemic&hl=&cd=76&source=gbs_api","1243765607",

Using a multifactor affine framework that allows for both systemic and sovereign-specific credit shocks, we find that there is considerable heterogeneity across U.S. and European issuers in their sensitivity to systemic risk. U.S. and Euro systemic shocks are highly correlated, but there is much less systemic risk among U.S. sovereigns than among European sovereigns. We also find that U.S. and European systemic sovereign risk is strongly related to financial market variables. These results provide strong support for the view that systemic sovereign risk has its roots in financial markets rather than in macroeconomic fundamentals.","2011","http://books.google.es/books?id=HLYdNAEACAAJ&dq=intitle:risk%2Bintitle:systemic&hl=&cd=84&source=gbs_api","OCLC:732253040",

Are Some Institutions Too Big to Fail and If So, what Should We Do about It?","intitle:risk+intitle:systemic","[United States Congress House]",,"Original publisher: Washington: U.S. G.P.O., 2009. LC Number: KF27 .B5 2009s OCLC Number: (OCoLC)551426256 Subject: Financial risk -- United States. Excerpt: ... 11 Now I want to, in my remaining 2 minutes, emphasize some issues of implementation I think are very important. The first is in terms of timing. I think the capital requirements can be phased in over time. I think the advantage of an economy that's bottoming out and starting to recover, you don't have to do this right away. The firms will likely - not for sure - will likely not engage in the same kind of restless risk-taking in the next 2 to 3 years. So there is some time to get ahead of this. But you really don't want to run through anything like the kind of boom that we have seen before. And of course this will reduce the profitability in this sector. No question about it. And the industry will point this out. They will be very cross with you, and they will tell you that this undermines productivity growth, and job creation in the United States. I see no evidence that is the case. I see no evidence that having an overleveraged financial system with excessive risk-taking does anything at all for growth in the real non-financial part of the economy. Now I would emphasize, though, two important pieces of this that we should also consider and that are more tricky. The first is foreign banks. So if we reduce the size of our banks, relative to the size of foreign banks, I think that does not create a competitive disadvantage for our industry. But it does raise the question of, ' ' How should you treat foreign banks operating in the United States?

Excerpt: ... identified as the OTC derivatives that were most similar to CDS in terms of the risks and challenges that they presented. The main risks from CDS include counterparty credit risk, operational Overview of the Risks and risk, concentration risk, and jump-to-default risk. In simple terms, Challenges Posed by CDS counterparty credit risk is the risk to each party in an OTC derivatives contract that the other party will not fulfill the obligations of the contract. In addition to potentially not receiving contractual payments, a purchaser of CDS whose counterparty fails would suddenly be left without protection and could either have to replace the CDS contract at current, higher market values or go without protection. Banks and other financial institutions that have large derivatives exposures use a variety of techniques to limit, forecast, and manage their counterparty risk, including margin and collateral posting requirements. However, regulators, market participants, and observers identified several challenges in managing CDS counterparty credit risk. First, although margin and collateral posting serve as a primary means of mitigating the risk of loss if a counterparty does not perform on its contractual obligations, calculating margin and collateral amounts can be difficult because of the challenges associated with determining the actual amount of counterparty exposure and the value of the reference asset. Specifically, it may be difficult for market participants to agree on the valuation of CDS contracts on ABS and CDOs. Second, margining practices are not standardized and vary depending on the counterparty. For example, market participants and observers suggested that institutions with high credit ratings, for which exposures were considered to pose little credit risk, were not initially required to post collateral. These firms included bond insurers...","2012-06","http://books.google.es/books?id=LNxgLwEACAAJ&dq=intitle:risk%2Bintitle:systemic&hl=&cd=164&source=gbs_api","1234111187",

Excerpt: ...11 One of the lessons learned from recent experience is that sectors of the market, such as the mortgage brokerage industry, can be systemically important even though no single institution in that sector is a significant player. The financial market stability regu-lator should have authority to gather information from all financial institutions and markets, adopt uniform regulations related to sys-temic risk, and act as a lender of last resort. In carrying out its duties, the financial market stability regulator should coordinate with the relevant functional regulators, as well as the President's Working Group, in order to avoid duplicative or conflicting regulation and supervision. It should also coordinate with regulators responsible for systemic risk in other countries. Although the financial market stability regulator's role would be distinct from that of the functional regulators, it should have a more direct role in the oversight of systemically important financial organizations, including the power to conduct examinations, take prompt corrective action, and appoint or act as the receiver or con-servator of such systemically important groups. These are more direct powers that would end if a financial group were no longer systemically important. We believe that all system-ically important financial institutions that are not currently subject to Federal functional regulation, such as insurance companies and hedge funds, should be subject to such regulation. We do not be-lieve the financial market stability regulator should play the day-to-day role for those entities. The ICI has suggested that hedge funds could be appropriately regulated by a merger of SEC and CFTC. We agree with that viewpoint.

Collective bodies of regulators can serve many use-ful purposes: examining latent problems, coordinating a response to new problems, recommending new action to plug regulatory gaps, and scrutinizing proposals for significant regulatory initiatives from all participating agencies. When it comes to specific regulations or programs or implemen-tation, though, collective bodies often diffuse responsibility and at-tenuate the lines of accountability, to which I know this Committee has paid so much attention. Achieving an effective mix of collective process and agency responsibility with an eye toward relevant in-stitutional incentives will be critical to successful reform.

A few points on regulatory simplification and consolidation. It is very important, I believe, that central banks and supervisors and market regulators together move to adopt a more integrated ap-proach to the design and enforcement of these capital standards and other prudential regulations that are critical to financial sta-bility. We need a more consistent set of rules, more consistently ap-plied, that substantially reduce the opportunities for arbitrage that exist in our current very segmented, fragmented system. Reducing moral hazard is critical. As we change the framework of regulation oversight, we need to do so in a way that strengthens market discipline over financial institutions and limits the moral hazard risk that is present in any regulated financial system. The liquidity tools of central banks and, to some extent, the emergency powers of other public authorities were created in the recognition of the fact of the basic reality that individual financial institutions cannot protect themselves fully from an abrupt evaporation in mar-ket liquidity or the ability to liquify their assets. Now the moral hazard that is associated with these lender-of-last-resort tools needs to be mitigated by strong supervisory au-thority over the consolidated financial entities that are critical to the financial system. On crisis management, the Congress gave the Federal Reserve very substantial tools, very substantial powers to mitigate the risk to the economy in any financial crisis.

Consequently, we would suggest that policy-makers, instead of creating distinctions between these types of en-tities, treat all private pool investment vehicles similarly, regard-less of their underlying investment strategies. Even though we may all use the term ' ' hedge fund ' ' in the context of today's hearing, the most accurate phrase is not ' ' hedge fund ' ' but ' ' private investment company. Second, in terms of investment activity, the buying or selling of securities or commodities or derivatives, hedge funds are but one type of many market participants engaged in the same activity. Again, in order to gain the most complete understanding of the subprime mortgage market, to use a recent example, one should not focus solely on a single segment of the market but should look at all participants engaged in that activity. Looking at mortgage securitizations solely through the prism of hedge funds without looking at banks, investment banks, insurance companies, and other types of dealers and investors will create a distorted picture of how and why that market operates as it does. This is not to say that hedge funds should not be included at all in such a distinction, quite to the contrary, we are an important part of the equation. But hedge funds are not nearly so significant in and of themselves that they should be the focus of attention to the exclusion of other market participants doing the same thing. A focus on the activity, not the actor, is more likely to yield the infor-mation desired by policymakers in assessing the appropriate level of oversight and regulation.

As someone who has designed incentive compensation plans for hundreds of employees in my own business over a 25-year career, I will tell you that it is not easy; that sometimes you pay people too much for too little performance and sometimes you pay people too little for too much performance, for a lot of performance. And the idea that somehow that some Washington bureaucracy, distant Washington bureaucrat, can do this better than people in a busi-ness and in the company is simply ludicrous. Also I believe the idea of having a direct shareholder vote opens up the idea of direct democracy within corporations which leads to the question of, well, should we also have them approve union con-tracts, approve major expenditures, etc., all of which arguably have done more to bring companies down over the years than excessive compensation.

The transactions are generally not subject to regulation by SEC, CFTC, or any other U.S. financial regulator. Thus, CDS and other OTC derivatives are not subject to the dis-closure and other requirements that are in place for most securities and exchange traded futures products. Although recent initiatives by regulators and industry have the potential to address some of the risk from CDS, these efforts are largely voluntary and do not include all CDS contracts. In addition, the lack of consistent and standardized margin and collateral practices continue to make managing counterparty credit risk and concentration risk difficult, and may allow systemically important exposures to accumulate without adequate collateral to mitigate associated risk. This area is a critical one and must be addressed going forward. Gaps in the regulatory oversight structure of and regulations governing financial products such as CDS allow these derivatives to grow unconstrained, and little analysis was done on their poten-tial for systemic risk. Regulators of major CDS dealers may have had some insight into the CDS market based on their oversight of the entities, but they had limited oversight of non-bank market participants such as hedge funds or operating subsidiaries of others like AIG Financial Products, whose CDS activities appear to have contributed to its fi-nancial difficulties. This fact clearly demonstrates that risk to the financial system and even the economy can result from institutions that exist within the spectrum of supervised entities. Further, the use of CDS creates interconnections among these entities, such that the failure of any one counterparty can have widespread implications regardless of its size.

A 10-by-10-by-10 Approach","intitle:risk+intitle:systemic","[Darrell Duffie]",,"Here, I present and discuss a ""10-by-10-by-10"" network-based approach to monitoring systemic financial risk. Under this approach, a regulator would analyze the exposures of a core group of systemically important financial firms to a list of stressful scenarios, say 10 in number. For each scenario, about 10 such designated firms would report their gains or losses. Each reporting firm would also provide the identities of the 10, say, counterparties with whom the gain or loss for that scenario is the greatest in magnitude relative to all counterparties. The gains or losses with each of those 10 counterparties would also be reported, scenario by scenario. Gains and losses would be measured in terms of market value and also in terms of cash flow, allowing regulators to assess risk magnitudes in terms of stresses to both economic values and also liquidity. Exposures would be measured before and after collateralization. One of the scenarios would be the failure of a counterparty. The ""top ten"" counterparties for this scenario would therefore be those whose defaults cause the greatest losses to the reporting firm. In eventual practice, the number of reporting firms, the number of stress scenarios, and the number of major counterparties could all exceed 10, but it is reasonable to start with a small reporting system until the approach is better understood and agreed upon internationally.","2011","http://books.google.es/books?id=79NNywAACAAJ&dq=intitle:risk%2Bintitle:systemic&hl=&cd=184&source=gbs_api","OCLC:746833190",

Answering this question requires a new approach since predictions using standard financial techniques and statistical distributions fail to predict or anticipate crises. The key points are that financial markets, systems, trading and manoeuvres are not just about money, debt, stocks, instruments and assets but reflect the actions and motivations of humans, which includes the presence or absence of learning effects. Therefore we have the possibility of failures or rare or low frequency events due to human involvement. The rare or unknown event is directly due to human influence, and reflects both learning and risk taking, with the presence of the finite and persistent human error contribution while taking or exposed to risk. This presence of humans in the marketplace explains the failure of present purely statistical methods to correctly estimate, predict or determine the onset of financial crises, busts and collapses. In this essay, we unify the concepts for predicting financial systemic risk with the general theory for outcomes, trends and measures already derived for other technical and social systems with human involvement. We replace words and qualitative reasoning with measures and quantitative predictions. The paper is therefore written with an introductory section devoted to the measures relevant to risk prediction in other modern technological systems; and is then extended and applied specifically to risk prediction for financial and business systems. The resulting measures also provide useful guidance for risk governance.","2011","http://books.google.es/books?id=WrFVlQEACAAJ&dq=intitle:risk%2Bintitle:systemic&hl=&cd=187&source=gbs_api","OCLC:732278980",
"Systemic risk and the refinancing ratchet effect","intitle:risk+intitle:systemic","[Amir E. Khandani, Andrew Wen-Chuan Lo, Robert C. Merton]",,"The confluence of three trends in the U.S. residential housing market---rising home prices, declining interest rates, and near-frictionless refinancing opportunities---led to vastly increased systemic risk in the financial system. Individually, each of these trends is benign, but when they occur simultaneously, as they did over the past decade, they impose an unintentional synchronization of homeowner leverage. This synchronization, coupled with the indivisibility of residential real estate that prevents homeowners from deleveraging when property values decline and homeowner equity deteriorates, conspire to create a ""ratchet"" effect in which homeowner leverage is maintained or increased during good times without the ability to decrease leverage during bad times. If refinancing-facilitated homeowner-equity extraction is sufficiently widespread---as it was during the years leading up to the peak of the U.S. residential real-estate market---the inadvertent coordination of leverage during a market rise implies higher correlation of defaults during a market drop. To measure the systemic impact of this ratchet effect, we simulate the U.S. housing market with and without equity extractions, and estimate the losses absorbed by mortgage lenders by valuing the embedded put-option in non-recourse mortgages. Our simulations generate loss estimates of $1.5 trillion from June 2006 to December 2008 under historical market conditions, compared to simulated losses of $280 billion in the absence of equity extractions.","2009","http://books.google.es/books?id=cHHOSAAACAAJ&dq=intitle:risk%2Bintitle:systemic&hl=&cd=188&source=gbs_api","OCLC:476699518",

In finance, systemic risk is the risk of collapse of an entire financial system or entire market, as opposed to risk associated with any one individual entity, group or component of a system. It can be defined as financial system instability, potentially catastrophic, caused or exacerbated by idiosyncratic events or conditions in financial intermediaries. It refers to the risks imposed by interlinkages and interdependencies in a system or market, where the failure of a single entity or cluster of entities can cause a cascading failure, which could potentially bankrupt or bring down the entire system or market. It is also sometimes erroneously referred to as systematic risk. As depositors sense the ripple effects of default, and liquidity concerns cascade through money markets, a panic can spread through a market, with a sudden flight to quality, creating many sellers but few buyers for illiquid assets.","2010-10-03","http://books.google.es/books?id=DSg-XwAACAAJ&dq=intitle:risk%2Bintitle:systemic&hl=&cd=191&source=gbs_api","6132900810",

"What is Systemic Risk and what Can be Done about It?. A Legal Perspective","intitle:risk+intitle:systemic","[Joanna Gray]",,"The global financial crisis challenges scholars from across many different disciplines to think about causes, immediate consequences and long term responses from the perspective of their particular disciplinary standpoint. This paper focuses on one particular response to the landscape and architecture of financial regulation that results from the lessons about the need to better recognise and counter risk to the financial system as a whole as opposed to its constituent parts and participants. One important policy response to the challenges posed by systemic risk has been the construction of the emergent macroprudential regulatory agenda that is now beginning to take root in practical forms and institutional architecture within the global, European and national spaces within which norms, standards and laws operate. It is argued here that this emerging agenda will challenge lawyers and legal systems more than may be being currently imagined.","2011","http://books.google.es/books?id=7Yp8uAAACAAJ&dq=intitle:risk%2Bintitle:systemic&hl=&cd=194&source=gbs_api","OCLC:772962721",

"Technical Capabilities Necessary for Systemic Risk Regulation. Summary of a Workshop","intitle:risk+intitle:systemic","[National Research Council]","[Business & Economics]","The financial reform plans currently under discussion in the United States recognize the need for monitoring and regulating systemic risk in the financial sector. To inform those discussions, the National Research Council held a workshop on November 3, 2009, to identify the major technical challenges to building such a capability. The workshop, summarized in this volume, addressed the following key issues as they relate to systemic risk: What data and analytical tools are currently available to regulators to address this challenge? What further data-collection and data-analysis capabilities are needed? What specific resource needs are required to accomplish the task? What are the major technical challenges associated with systemic risk regulation? What are various options for building these capabilities? Because every systemic event is unique with respect to its specific pathology--the various triggers and the propagation of effects--the workshop focused on the issues listed above for systemic risk in general rather than for any specific scenario. Thus, by design, the workshop explicitly addressed neither the causes of the current crisis nor policy options for reducing risk, and it attempted to steer clear of some policy issues altogether (such as how to allocate new supervisory responsibilities). More than 40 experts representing diverse perspectives participated in the workshop.","2010-01-25","http://books.google.es/books?id=7So2FzT5spwC&printsec=frontcover&dq=intitle:risk%2Bintitle:systemic&hl=&cd=199&source=gbs_api","0309149606",

Of primary interest in these studies is that of systemic risk, which has long been identified as a potential for financial institutions to trigger a dangerous contagion mechanism from the financial economy to the real economy itself. This type of risk, long confined to the monetary market, has spread widely in the recent past, culminating in the subprime crisis of 2008. The understanding and control of systemic risk has therefore become an extremely important societal and economic question.

"Market Discipline Under Systemic Risk. Evidence from Bank Runs in Emerging Economies","intitle:risk+intitle:systemic","[Eduardo Levy Yeyati, Maria Soledad Martinez Peria, Sergio L. Schmukler]","[Capital market]","""Levy-Yeyati, Martinez Peria, and Schmukler show that systemic risk exerts a significant impact on the behavior of depositors, sometimes overshadowing their responses to standard bank fundamentals. Systemic risk can affect market discipline both regardless of and through bank fundamentals. First, worsening systemic conditions can directly threaten the value of deposits by way of dual agency problems. Second, to the extent that banks are exposed to systemic risk, systemic shocks lead to a future deterioration of fundamentals not captured by their current values. Using data from the recent banking crises in Argentina and Uruguay, the authors show that market discipline is indeed quite robust once systemic risk is factored in. As systemic risk increases, the informational content of past fundamentals declines. These episodes also show how few systemic shocks can trigger a run irrespective of ex-ante fundamentals. Overall, the evidence suggests that in emerging economies, the notion of market discipline needs to account for systemic risk.

"Collateral, Netting and Systemic Risk in the OTC Derivatives Market","intitle:risk+intitle:systemic","[Manmohan Singh]",,"To mitigate systemic risk, some regulators have advocated the greater use of centralized counterparties (CCPs) to clear Over-The-Counter (OTC) derivatives trades. Regulators should be cognizant that large banks active in the OTC derivatives market do not hold collateral against all the positions in their trading book and the paper proves an estimate of this under-collateralization. Whatever collateral is held by banks is allowed to be rehypothecated (or re-used) to others. Since CCPs would require all positions to have collateral against them, off-loading a significant portion of OTC derivatives transactions to central counterparties (CCPs) would require large increases in posted collateral, possibly requiring large banks to raise more capital. These costs suggest that most large banks will be reluctant to offload their positions to CCPs, and the paper proposes an appropriate capital levy on remaining positions to encourage the transition.","2010-04-01","http://books.google.es/books?id=10JrdHH3XBAC&printsec=frontcover&dq=intitle:risk%2Bintitle:systemic&hl=&cd=204&source=gbs_api","1451982763",

This measure explicitly takes into account the indirect exchange rate risk that banks undertake when they lend to borrowers that will not be able to repay in the event of a sharp depreciation. Such systemic risk taking is not captured by indicators that are based only on banks’ balance sheet data. The new measure is constructed for 10 emerging European economies and for a broader sample that includes 19 additional emerging economies, for the period 1998 - 2008. Comparisons with previous currency mismatch measures that do not adjust for unhedged foreign currency borrowing illustrate the advantages of the new approach. In particular, the new measure flagged the indirect currency mismatch vulnerabilities that were building up in a number of emerging economies before the recent global crisis. Measuring currency mismatch more accurately can help country authorities in their efforts to address vulnerabilities at the right time, avoiding hurting growth prospects.","2010-11-01","http://books.google.es/books?id=we7LXzFEr8oC&printsec=frontcover&dq=intitle:risk%2Bintitle:systemic&hl=&cd=206&source=gbs_api","1455210706",

We find that short-term wholesale funding is a key determinant in triggering systemic risk episodes. In contrast, we find no evidence that a larger size increases systemic risk within the class of large global banks. We also show that the sensitivity of system-wide risk to an individual bank is asymmetric across episodes of positive and negative asset returns. Since short-term wholesale funding emerges as the most relevant systemic factor, our results support the Basel Committee's proposal to introduce a net stable funding ratio, penalizing excessive exposure to liquidity risk.","2012-02-01","http://books.google.es/books?id=SS35369eVbUC&printsec=frontcover&dq=intitle:risk%2Bintitle:systemic&hl=&cd=207&source=gbs_api","1463943660",

Monetary and Economic Dept]","[Business & Economics]","This paper extends the approach of measuring and stress-testing the systemic risk of a banking sector in Huang, Zhou, and Zhu (2009) to identifying various sources of financial instability and to allocating systemic risk to individual financial institutions. The systemic risk measure, defined as the insurance cost to protect against distressed losses in a banking system, is a summary indicator of market perceived risk that reflects expected default risk of individual banks, risk premia as well as correlated defaults. An application of our methodology to a portfolio of twenty-two major banks in Asia and the Pacific illustrates the dynamics of the spillover effects of the global financial crisis to the region. The increase in the perceived systemic risk, particularly after the failure of Lehman Brothers, was mainly driven by the heightened risk aversion and the squeezed liquidity. Further analysis, which is based on our proposed approach to quantifying the marginal contribution of individual banks to the systemic risk, suggests that 'too-big-to-fail' is a valid concern from a macroprudential perspective of bank regulation.","2010","http://books.google.es/books?id=ozkoAQAAMAAJ&dq=intitle:risk%2Bintitle:systemic&hl=&cd=213&source=gbs_api","IND:30000128935743",

"Systemic Liquidity Risk and Bipolar Markets. Wealth Management in Today's Macro Risk On / Risk Off Financial Environment","intitle:risk+intitle:systemic","[Clive M. Corcoran]","[Business & Economics]","The dramatic and well chronicled crisis of 2007/8 marked a watershed moment for all stakeholders in global capital markets. In the aftermath, financial markets have become even more tightly coupled as correlations in returns across multiple asset classes have been at historically elevated levels. Investors and fund managers are, to a much larger degree than previously and often much more than they realize, subject to the risk of severe wealth destruction. The ultimate hazard, which is not adequately characterized by the widely touted notion of tail risk, is the systemic risk which arises when liquidity in markets completely evaporates. Not only did this happen in the second half of 2008, but it has been repeated episodically since then – most notably in May 2010, in an incident known as the Flash Crash, and in the fall of 2011 when correlations were at historically elevated levels. Conventional asset allocation tools and techniques have failed to keep apace with the changing financial landscape which has emerged since 2008. In addition to the preponderance of algorithmic trading and the associated changes in the liquidity characteristics of financial markets, a new paradigm of risk on/risk off asset allocation has emerged. Risk on/risk off is a widely adopted style of trading and macro allocation strategy where positions are taken in several closely aligned asset classes depending on the prevailing sentiment or appetite for risk. The consequences of the day to day (and intraday) switching between either a risk on or risk off tactical strategies poses significant new challenges to investors who are still making investment decisions with outmoded notions from traditional asset allocation theory. How can one cushion the impact of systemically threatening events when the ability to exit financial instruments becomes almost non existent? How can one trust the integrity of financial models and orthodox macro financial theory which have become increasingly discredited? Can central bankers be relied upon to become the counter-parties of last resort and provide a safety net under the financial system? These vital questions, and many others, need to be addressed by everyone who has a stake in modern financial markets, and they are addressed in Systemic Liquidity Risk and Bipolar Markets. Proper functioning markets require fractiousness or divided opinion, and this needs to be lubricated by communications from central bankers, economic forecasters, corporate executives and so on. As long as such messages and market conditions remain ambiguous, providing asymmetric information to different market players, then the conditions are present to enable systemic liquidity to be preserved. Seen in this context the prevailing paradigm of bipolar risk on/risk off asset allocations is both a prerequisite to liquid markets, and also paradoxically, when one side of the polarity becomes too extreme, a major source of systemic instability. Should such polarities become critically unbalanced, and should the signals received by market players become symmetrically disadvantageous as they were in the fall of 2008, then an even more substantial systemic liquidity crisis than that seen in those troubled times is a dangerous possibility. Apart from the practical risk management tools and tactics that are recommended in Systemic Liquidity Risk and Bipolar Markets, there is a provocative and cogent narrative to provide anxious and perplexed investors with a coherent explanation of the post GFC financial environment, and which should assist them in navigating the choppy waters ahead.","2012-11-26","http://books.google.es/books?id=mKMd-z8R11sC&printsec=frontcover&dq=intitle:risk%2Bintitle:systemic&hl=&cd=215&source=gbs_api","1118410807",

Excerpt: ...11 and also regulators have a mixed track record of ensuring that par-ticipants in fact maintain market discipline, and I argue that this is a behavioral psychology effect. So I look at market discipline as a potential supplement to other regulatory approaches. In terms of recommendations, I propose that there be created a lender / market-maker of last resort, that to minimize moral hazard, the market-maker / lender of last resort could adopt a policy of con-structive ambiguity; that is that no third party would know when the lending or the market making would occur. And also, I show how this can be done in a way that only minimally transfers risk - transfers cost, I should say - to taxpayers. And this approach should be supplemented by market discipline approach. And to the extent none of those works, then you always have potential for ad hoc approaches. Now let me address the committee's specific questions. One is, what are the major challenges facing the U.S. financial regulators? And the immediate challenge of course is to instill additional inves-tor confidence in the financial markets. I argue that the recent monetary policy actions by the Fed are helpful, but they primarily impact banks, not financial markets, and that one, to the extent necessary, there should be a lender of last resort set up to deal with the situation with the markets ' collapse, similar to the tight coupling suggested by Mr. Bookstaber. Two, what challenges will regulators face going forward? I be-lieve regulators need to come to grips with changing market reali-ties in at least two ways. They should shift their focus from banks more to financial markets, to address the reality of financial disintermediation, the shifting from bank finance to capital market finance.

Excerpt: The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Pub.L. 111-203, H.R. 4173 ) is a federal statute in the United States that was signed into law by President Barack Obama on July 21, 2010. The Act is a product of the financial regulatory reform agenda of the Democratically controlled 111th United States Congress and the Obama administration. The law was initially proposed on December 2, 2009, in the House of Representatives by Barney Frank, and in the Senate Banking Committee by Chairman Chris Dodd. Due to their involvement with the bill, the conference committee that reported on June 29, 2010, voted to name the bill after the two members of Congress. The Act, which was passed as a response to the late-2000s recession, was touted as the most sweeping change to financial regulation in the United States since the Great Depression, and purportedly represented a significant change in the American financial regulatory environment affecting all Federal financial regulatory agencies and affecting almost every aspect of the nation's financial services industry.

One is a concept under which a firm would issue a specific kind of instrument which would have debt-like characteristics under normal circumstances, but by the terms of the instrument would itself have a conversion to eq-uity when some trigger event happened. The concept behind that tends to be the following. There is a pe-riod during which a firm may still be somewhat healthy, but is be-ginning to deteriorate, and if capital levels go down to a certain level there will be a loss of confidence within the markets and counterparties with respect to that firm. So if at that point the trig-ger means that all of a sudden there are X-billion dollars more of common equity in the firm, that might provide a reassurance and stop a slide downward, and I will come back to that in a moment. A second concept is really one which is as much about the poten-tial insolvency of the firm as it is stopping the slide. So some have proposed, for example, that all subordinated debtor all forms of debt other than specified senior tranches of debt would, at some moment, which would probably be the equivalent of when you are on the verge of insolvency, convert to equity, thereby, in effect, helping to move forward what would be a resolution process under another name, because now you have way less debt on the liability side of your balance sheet and more equity. The first is, I think, the concept that has intrigued some aca-demics, some regulators, and, I must say, some investment bankers who probably see the opportunity to create some new forms of in-vestment. The big issue there - there are a number of technical issues, but I think probably the biggest is what is the trigger going to be. If the trigger is supervisory discretion, you probably have an issue because everybody is going to be wondering whether the su-pe...","2012-06","http://books.google.es/books?id=7GRkLwEACAAJ&dq=intitle:risk%2Bintitle:systemic&hl=&cd=244&source=gbs_api","1234064995",

On the question of the death panels, which is otherwise called the resolving authority - ' ' death panel ' ' has such a wonderful ring to it. Just because it is entirely inaccurate in one area, it doesn't mean it should pass from the debate. I think we ought to - we will save the phrase and use it where it makes some sense, and that is the resolving authority. On the question about whether or not they should - I am out of time. So let me pose the question and you can elaborate on it. There is obviously a big debate about whether or not public funds ought ever to be available in resolving the mess left behind by one of these institutions. If you could answer it briefly now and elabo-rate in writing, I would appreciate that. Mr. V. In terms of the resolution authority, which would OLCKER give extraordinary authority to whatever agency is designated to control the institution, I do not think it is desirable to provide in that same arrangement authority to lend money or to provide money because that will encourage the ' ' too-big-to-fail ' ' kind of syn-drome. So if you give it strong enough authority to control the institu-tion and to manage such things as forcing, negotiating or forcing, whatever word you want use, let us say a conversion of debt into equity, hopefully you would avoid the need for injecting money and the stockholder would lose, the creditor might lose, and the creditor should be concerned about whether he is going to lose. Now, I would also say - I guess I didn't mention in this prelimi-nary statement - that if the overseer, for instance, identified an in-stitution or several institutions as being so large and so extended as to present a real risk, the...","2011-09","http://books.google.es/books?id=A8YLywAACAAJ&dq=intitle:risk%2Bintitle:systemic&hl=&cd=246&source=gbs_api","1234149516",

To provide a context for policy decisions designed to address the very real challenges associated with systemic risk, it sets out by way of case studies and real-life examples many of the important benefits that come from large, cross-border financial firms. It is important that these benefits are not lost in the search for solutions.

The main objective of the workshop was to present a state of the art on site-soil-structure-interaction effects, as manifested in the broader area of South and South-Eastern Europe, which is unquestionably the most seismically-prone region of the European continent. A second objective was to attempt a definition of the seismic risk posed to the built environment in this area and to present modern methods for seismic risk mitigation. Papers included in this volume are grouped into four chapters: (1) Site conditions and their role in seismic hazard analyses; (2) Soil-structure-interaction; (3) The role of site effects and of soil-structure-interaction in design of structures; and (4) General and related subjects.

"Credit Risk, Capital Structure and the Pricing of Equity Options","intitle:risk+intitle:structure","[Michael Hanke]","[Business & Economics]","This book is on option pricing in firm-value-based ('structural') credit risk models. Using modern techniques (change of numeraire) instead of directly solving partial differential equations (the main approach in the literature), closed-form pricing formulae for options on equity can be derived for a range of well-known models from this class. A common feature of these models is the assumption of an exogenously given firm value process, which leads to an endogenous equity (stock) price process. The stock price process depends directly on the firm's capital structure. This allows us not only to study credit risk effects in option prices, but also to investigate option price changes resulting from changes in a firm's capital structure. Numerical results illustrate the implications of our models. Numerous figures and tables allow for an easy comparison of various structural credit risk models.","2003","http://books.google.es/books?id=NyANmAg2ovAC&dq=intitle:risk%2Bintitle:structure&hl=&cd=12&source=gbs_api","321100520X",

Compared to short-term debt, long-term debt helps reduce rollover risks, but its illiquidity raises the costs of financing. With both default risk and liquidity costs changing over the business cycle, our calibrated model implies that debt maturity is pro-cyclical, firms with high systematic risk favor longer debt maturity, and that these firms will have more stable maturity structures over the cycle. Moreover, pro-cyclical maturity variation can significantly amplify the impact of aggregate shocks on the term structure of credit spreads, especially for firms with high beta, high leverage, or a lumpy maturity structure. We provide empirical evidence for the model predictions on both debt maturity and credit spreads.","2012","http://books.google.es/books?id=vr7BMwEACAAJ&dq=intitle:risk%2Bintitle:structure&hl=&cd=93&source=gbs_api","OCLC:809754192",

"Empirical Analysis of Farm Credit Risk Under the Structure Model","intitle:risk+intitle:structure","[Bing Yan Yan]",,"The study measures farm credit risk by using farm records collected by Farm Business Farm Management (FBFM) during the period 1995-2004. The study addresses the following questions: (1) whether farm's financial position is fully described by the structure model, (2) what are the determinants of farm capital structure under the structure model, (3) how to estimate and test farm asset correlation, (4) what drives farm default, and (5) how to predict farm default and joint default. In the first part of the empirical study, a seemingly unrelated regression (SUR) model is proposed to investigate the predicting capability of the structure model and test applicability of theories of financial structure to farm business. The model considers dynamic property of the structure model and farm characteristics. A semi-parametric three-stage least squares (3SLS) estimation method is proposed to obtain the estimates and test the model. In the second part, a farm's ability to meet its current and anticipated financial obligations in the next 12 months is predicted by the SUR model connected with credit rating models. In the third part of the study, copula approaches as an alternative are applied to measure farm credit risk under the structure model. Results indicate that the empirical dynamic model is stable, and the structure model is applicable in explaining most farms' choice of financial structure. In addition, the farms adjust to long-run financial targets for asset-to-debt ratio with additional financing needs following both pecking order and agency theories that is stronger for farms with greater asymmetric information problems. Application of the SUR model for measuring credit risk indicates that some key financial ratios in credit risk assessment such as liquidity should enter the model; these variables have significant influence on a farm's ability to meet its current and anticipated financial obligations in the next 12 months. The estimated average asset correlation is 20% while the average default correlation is around 1.2% across farms in the pool. The estimated average asset correlation is clearly higher than the reported average asset correlation of 16% by KMV's risk classing (Lopez 2002). The result indicates that the systematic risk plays a more important role in agricultural production in contrast to other industries. Estimated average asset correlation from Gaussian and t copula is 11%, similar to that by using a single factor model (Katchova and Barry 2005). The estimated average default correlation from Gaussian copula is less than 1% while it is 3% from t copula. Test results indicate that Gaussian copula is more proper for asset distribution as implied from the FBFM data than t copula. Results indicate that asset correlation is on average much higher than default correlation, which is consistent with previous findings by Crouchy et al. (2002) and Akhavein and Kocagil (2005). Results indicate that mean asset correlation from multi-factor model is clearly higher than that from Gaussian copula. This is also true for default correlation. Higher asset correlation and default correlation from the multi-factor model lead to relatively higher predicted probability of default and expected loss at portfolio level. Apart from difference in methodology for estimating asset correlation, the relatively lower estimated asset correlation under the copulas approach is more likely due to short time series observations for each involved farm. Overall, the predicted default rate and expected loss from the multi-factor model at one-year horizon are 0.77% and 0.19% respectively. These values are similar to those reported by FDIC for agricultural...","2011-09","http://books.google.es/books?id=wDJkywAACAAJ&dq=intitle:risk%2Bintitle:structure&hl=&cd=195&source=gbs_api","1243714514",

"Bank Ownership, Market Structure and Risk (EPub)","intitle:risk+intitle:structure","[Gianni De Nicoló, Elena Loukoianova]",,"This paper presents a model of a banking industry with heterogeneous banks that delivers predictions on the relationship between banks' risk of failure, market structure, bank ownership, and banks' screening and bankruptcy costs. These predictions are explored empirically using a panel of individual banks data and ownership information including more than 10,000 bank-year observations for 133 non-industrialized countries during the 1993-2004 period. Four main results obtain. First, the positive and significant relationship between bank concentration and bank risk of failure found in Boyd, De Nicolò and Al Jalal (2006) is stronger when bank ownership is taken into account, and it is strongest when state-owned banks have sizeable market shares. Second, conditional on country and firm specific characteristics, the risk profiles of foreign (state-owned) banks are significantly higher than (not significantly different from) those of private domestic banks. Third, private domestic banks do take on more risk as a result of larger market shares of both state-owned and foreign banks. Fourth, the model rationalizes this evidence if both state-owned and foreign banks have either larger screening and/or lower bankruptcy costs than private domestic banks, banks' differences in market shares, screening or bankruptcy costs are not too large, and loan markets are sufficiently segmented across banks of different ownership.","2007-09-01","http://books.google.es/books?id=ajmphnNd_0EC&printsec=frontcover&dq=intitle:risk%2Bintitle:structure&hl=&cd=197&source=gbs_api","1452735980",
"Risk and the Corporate Structure of Banks","intitle:risk+intitle:structure","[Giovanni Dell'Ariccia, Robert Marquez]",,"We identify different sources of risk as important determinants of banks' corporate structures when expanding into new markets. Subsidiary-based corporate structures benefit from greater protection against economic risk because of affiliate-level limited liability, but are more exposed to the risk of capital expropriation than are branches. Thus, branch-based structures are preferred to subsidiary-based structures when expropriation risk is high relative to economic risk, and vice versa. Greater cross-country risk correlation and more accurate pricing of risk by investors reduce the differences between the two structures. Furthermore, the corporate structure affects bank risk taking and affiliate size.","2010-02-01","http://books.google.es/books?id=YvJkMnQqXtEC&printsec=frontcover&dq=intitle:risk%2Bintitle:structure&hl=&cd=198&source=gbs_api","1451962908",
"Structure and Continuity of Psychopathology Dimensions in a High-risk Sample","intitle:risk+intitle:structure","[Keith Byron Burt]",,"Recent factor analytic work from adult psychopathology has centered attention on broad vulnerability domains of internalizing and externalizing problems, domains central to assessment of youth behavioral and emotional problems for many years. However, little work has examined links between questionnaire-based youth measures and structured clinical interview data using latent variable methods. In addition, the robustness of adult factor models to at-risk and modest sample sizes is in question. The present study examined these and related questions by linking confirmatory factor models of the Achenbach Youth Self-Report (YSR) at age 16 and Young Adult Self-Report (YASR) at age 26 with structured clinical interview data from ages 17.5 and 28 and by testing for longitudinal measurement invariance. Results give robust support for moderately correlated and highly stable factors of internalizing and externalizing that are largely consistent across age and assessment instrument. However, metric invariance of factor loadings was demonstrated only for Achenbach measures, not for structured interview data, suggesting that certain aspects of the broad factors may differ across time. Findings are discussed with respect to methodological issues in confirmatory factor analysis and conceptual issues in the assessment of psychopathology.","2007","http://books.google.es/books?id=Oaj2AHIt-eUC&printsec=frontcover&dq=intitle:risk%2Bintitle:structure&hl=&cd=199&source=gbs_api","0549218335",

The principal attraction of RB seems to be the belief that its revenues are stable & thus can offset volatility in non-retail bus. Interest in RB activities fluctuates with the performance of non-retail banking & financial market activities.

Information from both nominal and index-linked yields is used in the empirical analysis. Our results indicate that term premia in the euro area yield curve reflect predominantly real risks, i.e. risks which affect the returns on both nominal and index-linked bonds. On average, inflation risk premia were negligible during the EMU period but occasionally subject to statistically significant fluctuations in 2004-2006. Movements in the raw break-even rate appear to have mostly reflected such variations in inflation risk premia, while long-term inflation expectations have remained remarkably anchored from 1999 to date."" - - Abstract.","2007","http://books.google.es/books?id=uTEoAQAAMAAJ&dq=intitle:risk%2Bintitle:structure&hl=&cd=214&source=gbs_api","IND:30000115510848",

This is based on the stochastic discount factor model of asset pricing with observable macroeconomic factors. The joint distribution of excess holding period US bond returns of different maturity and the fundamental macroeconomic factors is modelled using multivariate GARCH with conditional covariances in the mean to capture the term premia. We show how by testing the assumption of no arbitrage we can derive a specification test of our model. We estimate the contribution made to the term premia at different maturities by real and nominal macroeconomic sources of risk. From the estimated term premia we recover the term structure of interest rates and examine how it varies through time. Finally, we examine whether the large number of reported failures of the rational expectations hypothesis of the term structure can be attributed to an omitted time-varying term premium.","2004","http://books.google.es/books?id=y1LmSgAACAAJ&dq=intitle:risk%2Bintitle:structure&hl=&cd=235&source=gbs_api","OCLC:237921654",

"Capital Structure and Risk Dynamics Among Banks. The Relationship Between Capital Structure and Risk Exposure Among Emerging Market Banks","intitle:risk+intitle:structure","[Keegan Floquet]",,"In an attempt to restore banking stability and safety during the 1980's, bank regulators typically introduced explicit minimum capital regulation to increase capital ratios and moderate risk-taking. The effects of bank regulation on the capital and risk levels of banks are not always as intended; in some cases, promoting moral hazard behaviour and further increasing the probability of insolvency. Some of these effects were at the roots of the Global Financial Crisis. This book aims to explore in greater detail the relationship between capital and risk, the reasons for this relationship and why this relationship in emerging market banks may differ from that of banks in developed markets. A comprehensive analysis of corporate financial theory relating to capital and risk are carried out and form the theoretical basis of this study.","2011-03","http://books.google.es/books?id=mnWxuAAACAAJ&dq=intitle:risk%2Bintitle:structure&hl=&cd=264&source=gbs_api","3844312056",
"Are Two Parents Always Better Than One? The Moderating Effect of Parental Risk Factors on Associations Between Family Structure and Early Child Outcomes","intitle:risk+intitle:structure","[Rebecca M. Ryan]",,"This study investigated associations between family structure and early child cognitive and socioemotional outcomes by asking whether associations typically found in studies on family structure and child development are consistent across family contexts. Put simply, I asked if two parent families are always better for children than single parent ones and if married parent families are always better for children than those of unwed parents. If these family structures are always better than the alternatives, I asked if they are always better or worse to the same degree. To address this question, I compared the absolute and relative advantages of paternal coresidence and marriage for children whose parents were at-risk to the advantages for children whose parents were not at-risk. Risk groups included children whose parents had low educational levels, were young, were unemployed, exhibited risky behaviors such as substance use and criminal activity, and reported depressive symptoms. Data were drawn from the baseline, one-year and three-year follow-ups of the Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing Study (FFCWS). Child cognitive and behavioral outcomes were examined at age 3 and paternal risks were examined at baseline. Paternal coresidence emerged as a benefit to children's behavioral development among children of non-substance abusing fathers and children of depressed mothers; living with an unemployed father had a slight negative effect on children's cognitive outcomes. Marriage emerged as a protective factor for children's behavioral development in socioeconomically at-risk homes when compared to cohabitation, but was not associated with benefits to behavioral development in more advantaged homes; by contrast, only in more socioeconomically advantaged families did marriage seem to benefit cognitive outcomes. The overarching hypothesis that paternal risk factors would moderate associations between family structure and early child outcomes was supported, although interactive effects were often quite modest.","2006","http://books.google.es/books?id=2ig6Bx__XLIC&dq=intitle:risk%2Bintitle:structure&hl=&cd=265&source=gbs_api","0542918102",

"Principal-agent, Risk, and Market Structure Effects on Health Maintenance Organization Choice of Payment Method for Primary Care Physicians","intitle:risk+intitle:structure","[Mary A. Laschober]",,"This research analyzes determinants of HMO compensation (salary, fee-for-service, and capitation) for primary care physicians. First, a theoretical model is constructed to analyze physician preferences for fee-for-service versus capitation based on payment risk characteristics. The analysis shows that capitation can be less risky than fee-for-service. A physician's ranking of payment methods may depend on her utility function, the health distribution of HMO members, and the relationship between payment schedules and the health distribution of HMO members. In some circumstances, an HMO can pay less under capitation and still make a physician as well off as under fee-for-service. Second, a principal-agent framework is used to determine optimal incentive contracts between HMOs and physicians, whose relationship is characterized as one of moral hazard with hidden information. The wage-cost minimizing contract for the strategy in which an HMO wants a physician to treat each patient type with appropriate care is downward sloping and concave in treatment. This payment structure is similar to ""mixed reimbursement"" schemes in which physicians receive capitated payment, but incur only a fraction of treatment costs. The results also show that payment methods that maximize HMO profits are influenced by local market conditions, physician preferences, and other factors. There are strong economic reasons for the diverse payment arrangements used by HMOs. Third, a multivariate logistic regression model is used to estimate the probability that an IPA-model HMO will choose a particular payment method given physician and IPA bargaining power, local market HMO competition, and IPA organizational features. The results indicate that IPAs react more to potential competition than current market conditions in adopting a cost-containment mechanism such as capitation. In addition, the average enrollment-to-PCP ratio and operating age of an IPA have a positive influence on capitation. HMOs can more easily negotiate capitated payments the more patients they can guarantee to PCPs. Age is a factor because HMOs may initially pay physicians fee-for-service to facilitate contracting and expand more rapidly, but they eventually shift risk and cost-containment incentives to physicians through capitation.","1996","http://books.google.es/books?id=qz7mygAACAAJ&dq=intitle:risk%2Bintitle:structure&hl=&cd=269&source=gbs_api","OCLC:36833765",

The model incorporates three key features: i) value-maximizing insurers and reinsurers face product-market as well as capital market imperfections that give rise to well-founded concerns with risk management and capital allocation; ii) some, but not all, of the risks they face can be frictionlessly hedged in the capital market; iii) the distribution of their cashflows may be asymmetric, which alters the demand for underwriting and hedging. We show that these features result in a three-factor model that determines the pricing and allocation of risk and the optimal capital structure of the firm. This approach allows us to integrate these features into: i) the pricing of risky investment, underwriting, reinsurance, and hedging; and ii) the allocation of risk across all of these opportunities, and the optimal amount of surplus capital held by the firm.","2003","http://books.google.es/books?id=vVKTlAEACAAJ&dq=intitle:risk%2Bintitle:structure&hl=&cd=273&source=gbs_api","OCLC:249695697",

"Bond Risk, Bond Return Volatility, and the Term Structure of Interest Rates","intitle:risk+intitle:structure","[Luis M. Viceira]",,"This paper explores time variation in bond risk, as measured by the covariation of bond returns with stock returns and with consumption growth, and in the volatility of bond returns. A robust stylized fact in empirical finance is that the spread between the yield on long-term bonds and short-term bonds forecasts positively future excess returns on bonds at varying horizons, and that the short-term nominal interest rate forecasts positively stock return volatility and exchange rate volatility. This paper presents evidence that movements in both the short-term nominal interest rate and the yield spread are positively related to changes in subsequent realized bond risk and bond return volatility. The yield spread appears to proxy for business conditions, while the short rate appears to proxy for inflation and economic uncertainty. A decomposition of bond betas into a real cash flow risk component, and a discount rate risk component shows that yield spreads have offsetting effects in each component. A widening yield spread is correlated with reduced cash-flow (or inflationary) risk for bonds, but it is also correlated with larger discount rate risk for bonds. The short rate forecasts only the discount rate component of bond beta.","2007","http://books.google.es/books?id=4KZaMQAACAAJ&dq=intitle:risk%2Bintitle:structure&hl=&cd=275&source=gbs_api","OCLC:164860957",

Data were sourced from the Annual Report and Accounts of the sampled firms and the publications of Central Bank of Nigeria. Descriptive method and Generalized Method of Moment (GMM) were used to analyze data. The results indicate a positive coefficient between financial risk and capital structure and those Nigerian companies with higher financial risk tend to use more short-term debt in general. Also, profitability, tangibility, corporate tax rate, age of the firm, earning power, volatility, inflation and foreign direct investment, have significantly positive effects on capital structure. In addition, thirty-eight firms adjust fully to their target capital, while thirty-two over adjust. The study concluded that effective financial risk management and good financing policy decision would greatly improve firms performance in Nigeria.","2010-09","http://books.google.es/books?id=8a2ucQAACAAJ&dq=intitle:risk%2Bintitle:structure&hl=&cd=279&source=gbs_api","3843350272",

Using a sample of 495 project finance loan tranches from61 countries, worth $151 billion, we document high levels of debt ownership concentration: the largest single bankholds 20.3% while the top five banks collectively hold 61.2% of a typical project finance loan tranche. We also show that weak creditor rights and poor legal enforcement are associated with more diffuse ownership structures, which leads us to conclude that international project finance lenders structure syndicates to deter strategic default rather than to enhance monitoring incentives or facilitate low-cost re-contracting in the event of default. On a more theoretical level, the results illustrate the continuous nature of debt ownership and refute the overly simplistic distinction between single bank and atomistic public bondholders commonly described in the literature.","2002","http://books.google.es/books?id=Vc4CHQAACAAJ&dq=intitle:risk%2Bintitle:structure&hl=&cd=287&source=gbs_api","OCLC:49322045",

The family is particularly relevant to a discussion of nursing home admission, given its critical role in providing care to older disabled persons. Using data from the New Haven EPESE, the author examines the relationship between family structure and the risk of first nursing home admission. Family structure is defined more broadly than in most previous studies and includes not only the spouse, but also sons, daughters, and siblings. Because of the relatively lengthy follow-up period of the EPESE, the author is able to depart from previous methodological conventions, adopting a continuous time survival model with age at admission as the outcome and time-varying measures of family structure and health. Results show that married older persons have about half the risk of nursing home admission of unmarried persons, and that having at least one daughter or sibling reduces and older person's chances of admission by about one-fourth.","1996","http://books.google.es/books?id=TyE3GwAACAAJ&dq=intitle:risk%2Bintitle:structure&hl=&cd=288&source=gbs_api","OCLC:35788848",

If the print book includes a CD-ROM, this content is not included within the eBook version.From oil companies seeking rights to drill to consumer products firms attempting to forestall a consumer boycott, organizations often seek to influence political or social policy to achieve their own objectives. But to exert this influence, they need to understand the structure of political and social networks. In this chapter, Witold Henisz examines how information about the structure of political and social networks can be integrated into data acquisition and analysis, as well as strategy implementation. Although sophisticated companies have long relied on an informal understanding of networks of informants to gather information about social and political actors at home and abroad, the analysis of the information and design of an influence strategy has too often occurred without reference to that structure. As Henisz points out, a more rigorous approach to analysis is transforming political and social risk management from art to quasi-formal science. This chapter outlines the past, present, and future frontiers of political and social risk management with particular attention to using an understanding of the network structure of diverse actors in perceiving, analyzing, and influencing the political and social environment.","2009-05-15","http://books.google.es/books?id=ZFYFfHa7-B8C&printsec=frontcover&dq=intitle:risk%2Bintitle:network&hl=&cd=6&source=gbs_api","0137024517",

"T-Copula Based Credit Risk Modeling in a Network Economy","intitle:risk+intitle:network","[Vigen Isayan]",,"The principal motivation of our paper is to extend upon the results obtained by Didier Cossin and Henry Schellhorn (henceforth CS) in their joint paper titled ""Credit Risk in a Network Economy"" by introducing and implementing a t-copula based credit risk model where credit risk interdependencies between firms in the network are modeled using t-copula structure. CS model is based on a network economy where any firm can lend to any other firm and so each firm is subject to counterparty risk either from direct borrowers or from remote firms in the network. Under these general lending/borrowing relationships the network economy is modeled as Cox/M/infinity queueing network with Bernoulli routing where arrivals representing queue lengths act as buffers to cash flow bankruptcy risks. Under this network setup strategic bankruptcy decision of shareholders gets decoupled from cash flow risk which as in other structural models drives the credit spread. Taking into account the role of each firm's cash management and the network setup described above Cossin and Schellhorn were able to obtain, in the steady state of the network, semi-closed form formulas for both equity and debt price of each firm in the network. Recognizing the potential advantage (in terms of ease of implementation and accuracy) that CS framework can offer in pricing multi-name credit risk contracts by embedding the t-copula dependence structure into the above network setup initiated our research. To implement our model we chose a network of large manufacturing and service industry firms to satisfy the assumptions of large sizeable cash account and rigid debt structure required in the CS model. We conduct our study in the context of US airlines-aerospace industry and test our t-copula based CS model against CS model based on Gaussian copula to see which model better captures default dependence and hence more accurately price basket credit derivatives. Our statistical tests proved the prevailing fact about the choice of t-copula as an underlying dependence structure and as such it should price the basket credit derivatives more accurately than CS model based on other dependence structures.","2011-09","http://books.google.es/books?id=zMlLywAACAAJ&dq=intitle:risk%2Bintitle:network&hl=&cd=9&source=gbs_api","1243721170",

"Network-based Risk Mitigation and Resource Evaluation in the Transportation of Hazardous Materials and Terrorist Threat","intitle:risk+intitle:network","[Justin Timothy Yates]",,"The expanse of U.S. transportation systems has helped to facilitate persistent national economic growth, its ease of access and reliability vital to the plethora of users who utilize daily the established infrastructure. Recent events have shown cause for concern, however, as the vulnerability inherent in such transportation systems has been exploited by the calculated attacks of highly motivated individuals and groups who have used these networks to target the connected critical infrastructure and human populations. This research focuses on the protection of large geographic regions, and the critical components contained within, in their susceptibility to covert attacks using hazardous materials vehicles as the tool of implementation. Focusing on the detection and interception of such attacks, this work introduces three mathematical models responsible for the placement of varying types of sensors within a geographic region of interest and employs a hypercube spatial queuing model to ascertain response unit functionality and capability given the sensor network schema. The regions of Lancaster-Palmdale, California and Northridge, California are used in the systematic examination of model performance and solution characteristics. A case study within the region of Los Angeles County, California is offered as a demonstration of the success of the model to cope with networks and parameters of realistic scope and scale. The results of model implementation show trends in the application of sensor networks as a means to regional vulnerability reduction and infrastructure protection and illustrate the relationship between sensor placement and the successful instantiation of a response team and the allocation of its individual units. The complete model relies heavily on a Geographic Information System (GIS) for the manipulation and management of all network and sensor data and combines integer programming and queuing theory concepts in the development of an integrated detection and interception model for the protection of multiple points of critical infrastructure within a large geographic region.","2008","http://books.google.es/books?id=YX02-7OGPVkC&printsec=frontcover&dq=intitle:risk%2Bintitle:network&hl=&cd=14&source=gbs_api","0549735291",

"Scenario-based Supply Chain Network Risk Modeling","intitle:risk+intitle:network","[Walid Klibi, Alain Martel]",,"This paper provides a risk modeling approach for Supply Chain Networks (SCNs) operating under uncertainty. It recognizes three event types to characterize the future SCN environment: random, hazardous and deeply uncertain events. A three-phase hazard modeling approach is proposed. It involves a characterization of SCN hazards in terms of multihazards, vulnerability sources and exposure levels, the estimation of incident arrival, intensity and duration processes, and the assessment of SCN hit consequences in terms of damage and time to recovery. A Monte Carlo approach is also proposed to generate plausible future scenarios. Two realistic cases are examined to illustrate the key aspects of the approach, and to demonstrate its usefulness for SCN design under uncertainty.--Résumé de l'éditeur.","2011","http://books.google.es/books?id=2OJ9twAACAAJ&dq=intitle:risk%2Bintitle:network&hl=&cd=22&source=gbs_api","2895243611",

"Network Reconfiguration for Supply Chain Risk Mitigation","intitle:risk+intitle:network","[Satama Sirivunnabood]",,"Risks and uncertainties around the globe have been evident as severe threats against reliable operations of supply chain networks. In order to survive the volatile conditions that characterize the current global environment, firms must prepare strategies that mitigate the effects of risks on their supply chain networks. This research proposes supply chain risk mitigation strategy based on supply chain network design under uncertainty and integrated advanced Information Technology (IT) architecture. The main objectives of this research include (1) understanding the impacts of risks on a supply chain network, (2) developing an approach to designing a robust supply chain network under risk, and (3) designing an information system architecture for a supply chain network under risk. In particular, we propose an architecture for network reconfiguration in a supply chain network operating under risk. Such a reconfigurable supply chain network has the ability to respond to risks as they arise and adjust its configuration accordingly to avoid catastrophic failure. To achieve a reconfigurable supply chain, three main components have been developed including an uncertain parameter database in which knowledge about the effects of risks is stored, a stochastic network optimization module that is responsible for determining long-term supply chain network configuration using a two-stage stochastic programming model, and a network configuration controller used to facilitate operations among supply chain nodes. Specifically, the information system of this reconfigurable supply chain network is based on the principle of Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA), such that heterogeneous nodes with diverse enterprise software platforms can communicate and integrate with each other seamlessly. The first section focuses on obtaining knowledge about the effects of risk on a supply chain. This section proposes a Multi-Agent-base Simulation (MAS) model based on the well-known Gaia methodology and Unified Modeling Language (UML) standard and details it use in simulation experiments to gather knowledge about the network design parameters of the supply chain. In the second part, the knowledge obtained from the MAS model is used to formulate a two-stage stochastic programming model to redesign a supply chain network under risk in the stochastic network optimization module. The Sample Average Approximation (SAA) and L-Shaped decomposition methods are used to solve this supply chain network redesign problem efficiently. Additionally, three different sampling techniques are used to generate random numbers to the SAA method including Simple Random Sampling (SRS), Latin Hypercube Sampling (LHS), and Sobol' sequence technique. Results from numerical experiments showed that the LHS technique are the most efficient for solving small problems, whereas, Sobol sequence technique is more efficient for addressing moderate or large problems. In the third section, the network configuration obtained from the stochastic network optimization module is implemented on a reconfigurable supply chain network developed based on the SOA principle. The results from simulation experiments show that the network reconfiguration framework via the use of the SOA enables discoverability and interoperability in the supply chain and is capable of improving the supply chain performance in the presence of risk.","2012-05","http://books.google.es/books?id=AFt3LwEACAAJ&dq=intitle:risk%2Bintitle:network&hl=&cd=81&source=gbs_api","1248951123",
"Contextualizing Social Network Influences on Substance Use Among High Risk Adolescents.","intitle:risk+intitle:network","[Patchareeya Pumpuang Kwan]",,"Social network influences predict how we act and behave. Most people tend to comply with social norms and beliefs so that they are accepted by society. Characterized by physical, emotional and mental changes, adolescents are no different when it comes to social conformity. Peer influences become a strong predictor of how adolescents act and behave. Many of these individuals behave in ways that are encouraged and acceptable by peers despite the delinquent nature of the behavior. The purpose of this dissertation is to understand adolescent social influence and contextualized social networks as it relates to drug use. The purpose of the first analysis, depicted in chapter 2, is to examine intentions as a mediator of the relationship between friend approval of drug use and drug use. Data on drug use was examined in roughly 400 alternative high school students. Best friends' approval of drug use was used as the independent variable with use of alcohol, marijuana, cigarette, hard drugs and a composite drug use score were used as the dependent variables. Drug use intentions is the mediator variable of interest. Mixed model logistic regression was used to conduct mediation analysis as described in Baron and Kenny, 1986. Results of this analysis showed that behavioral intentions fully mediated the relationship between best friend's approval and cigarettes and marijuana use. Intentions partially mediated the relationship between approval and hard drug use. This is consistent with past research and theoretical models such as the Theory of Reasoned Action. In chapter 3 we will look at the second set of analysis concerning bilingualism as a possible protective factor against adolescent drug use. Logistic regression using school and classroom as the random effect was conducted on approximately 880 male and female students in alternative high schools. Outcome variables of interest were baseline use of alcohol, marijuana, cigarette, hard drugs and a composite drug use variable. Age, gender, ethnicity, SES, acculturation and number of best friends were used as controlled variables. Individual bilingualism scores and best friends' bilingualism scores (i.e. the level of bilingualism of the individual's five best friends) were the predictor variables of interest. Results indicated that among males and females, best friends' bilingualism decreased the probability of alcohol, marijuana and cigarette use. Sub-group analysis by sex reveals that among males, bilingualism was not associated with drug use but among females best friend bilingualism was associated with decreasing the probability of alcohol, marijuana, cigarettes and all drug use. These findings suggest differences in how male and female students are influenced by their bilingual peers. Chapter 4 examines the association between peer leader drug use behaviors and the behaviors of the individual students. Logistic regression using school, classroom and network group as the random effects was used to analyze post intervention drug use behaviors of approximately 525 male and female students. Students were randomized into three groups -- control, standard curriculum or networked curriculum where students were grouped according to self reported group leader nominations. Peer leader drug usage behavior was the independent variable of interest. Individual drug use was the outcome being examined. Results showed that among the combined male and female group, there was no significant association between peer leader use and post-test drug use. Among males only, peer leader use at baseline was positively associated with alcohol use and peer leader use at post-test was positively associated with hard drug...","2011-09-08","http://books.google.es/books?id=z4q6uAAACAAJ&dq=intitle:risk%2Bintitle:network&hl=&cd=82&source=gbs_api","1243738359",

"Risk Propagation Assessment for Network Security. Application to Airport Communication Network Design","intitle:risk+intitle:network","[M. Ben Mahmoud, M. Larrieu, M. Pirovano]",,"This book deals with risk assessment methodologies for network architecture design. The main goal is to present and to illustrate an innovative risk propagation-based quantitative assessment tool. This original approach aims to help network designers and security administrators to design and to build more robust and secure network topologies. As an implementation case study, we consider an aeronautical network based on the AeroMACS (Aeronautical Mobile Airport Communications System) technology. AeroMACS has been identified as the wireless access network for airport surface communications which will be soon deployed in European and American airports mainly for communications between aircraft and airlines. It is based on the IEEE 802.16-2009 standard also known as WiMAX. The first part of this book is an introduction to information system security risk management process. The second part presents the different risk management methodologies that can be used currently (quantitative and qualitative ones). In the third section, our original quantitative network risk assessment model based on risk propagation is introduced. Finally, the last section presents a network case study of the future airport AeroMACS system. This example illustrates how our quantitative risk assessment proposal can provide help to network security designers for the decision making process and how the security of the entire network may be hence improved.","2013-03-19","http://books.google.es/books?id=Ete-MQEACAAJ&dq=intitle:risk%2Bintitle:network&hl=&cd=84&source=gbs_api","1848214545",

"Allocation Strategy for Production Network Designed to Mitigate Risk","intitle:risk+intitle:network","[Roy Jacob Lehman (III)]",,"Amgen Inc. currently manufactures, formulates and fills substantially all of their global drug product units in a single primary facility (""Site 1A""). Concerned about the inherent risks posed by the geographic concentration of these activities, Amgen has decided to acquire a new international Risk Mitigation Site (""RMS""), expand existing bulk manufacturing infrastructure at Site 1A, and construct a new formulation and filling facility colocated with Site 1A (""Site IB""). Bringing both sites online in the near future will create a novel operational challenge for Amgen, as it will present a broad range of formulation/fill production allocation decisions that did not previously exist. If per-unit costs (production, logistics, etc.) were considered to be typically higher at either RMS or Site 1A/B, an unconstrained optimization model might suggest filling/finishing all product at whichever site has the lowest average cost. However, we assume that RMS should be able to ramp up to full capacity within 3 months of an adverse occurrence at Site 1A. This translates to a minimum product flow constraint through RMS, irrespective of per unit costs, that will keep the facility sufficiently staffed to prepare for a fast ramp-up. Furthermore, helping Amgen mitigate the risks of geographic concentration, RMS may typically produce only a portion of global demand for any product. Given this situation, this thesis develops a product allocation strategy that will: 1) minimize the financial cost of filling various quantities of drug product at the new facility, yet 2) maintain at RMS the expertise required begin manufacturing all drugs in a short period of time. A mixed-integer linear program (""MILP"") was developed to capture variable costs of the formulation & fill process for each drug product (""DP"") and market combination. The objective of this model is to minimize total supply chain costs subject to meeting market demand and maintaining a sufficient amount of product flow through the RMS facility. The analysis assumes that the decision to develop fill capacity at both RMS and Site lB is complete and that both facilities will be licensed to fill all products that currently run through Site 1A (i.e. capital investment decisions will not be analyzed in this study). The outcome of this study is a product allocation strategy that minimizes network costs as well as a tool that will enable Amgen to solve for minimal network costs under additional future scenarios.","2011","http://books.google.es/books?id=V_BEtwAACAAJ&dq=intitle:risk%2Bintitle:network&hl=&cd=87&source=gbs_api","OCLC:753962996",
"Risk from Network Disruptions in an Aerospace Supply Chain","intitle:risk+intitle:network","[Bryan Keith Wilson]",,"This thesis presents methods for determining the effects of risk from disruptions using an aerospace supply chain as the example, primarily through the use of a computer simulation model. Uncertainty in the current marketplace requires managers to be cognizant of the adverse impact of risk on their company's performance. However, managers who lack formal procedures for dealing with the potential impact of risk often are caught not knowing how much to invest in risk mitigation strategies. A computer simulation model representing a supply chain for a space vehicle was used to test different disruption scenarios to determine their impact on total production duration time. Scenarios ranging from suppliers not providing parts on time to quality test failures to disease pandemics were all considered. Randomness was incorporated through use of a stochasticity factor that was applied uniformly throughout the model. Output of the model was used to develop confidence percentiles for the complete duration times. Through testing of the various scenarios using the model we learned that most disruptions will add a deterministic time to the total estimated duration time of the system, regardless of the location of the disruption in the supply chain. In addition, we showed that a thorough review must be performed when choosing the stochasticity factor due to its large influence in determining total duration times and performance percentiles. The creation of the confidence percentiles allows the aerospace company to use the model throughout the entire 3 to 4 year production process to continually update and evaluate their buffer times and likelihood of meeting target completion dates. This buffer time can then be turned into a key performance index to better manage this supply chain. This model was created for a real supply chain, and it is currently being used by the aerospace company to help them plan and make appropriate decisions in regards to risk mitigation strategies in preparation for production of the space vehicle. They hope to expand the use of computer simulation models throughout the rest of their division to help drive down costs by increasing efficiencies in their planning.","2010","http://books.google.es/books?id=WJX1ZwEACAAJ&dq=intitle:risk%2Bintitle:network&hl=&cd=88&source=gbs_api","OCLC:700945020",
"Using Operational Risk Management (ORM) to Improve Computer Network Defense (CND) Performance in the Department of the Navy (DON)","intitle:risk+intitle:network","[Ernest D. Hernandez]",,"Operational Risk Management (ORM) has been credited with reducing the Navy's mishap rate to all time lows, especially in Naval Aviation. Through the use of a five-step process, ORM has been able to change the decision makers' paradigm of day-to-day operations in naval fleet units, making safety the paramount factor that would allow fleet commanding officers to conserve their assets, yet meet the requirement to train in high-risk environments. ORM is a process that mitigates the risk associated with the high-risk environment that naval fleet units operate in. Not unlike naval fleet units, our computer networks, operate in a high-risk environment-the Internet. Crackers are able to penetrate what were thought to be secure networks, and copy, modify, disrupt or destroy valuable information The risk posed to the Navy's computer network systems is very great. Given the Navy's adoption of 'Network-Centric Warfare' and the Navy-Marine Corps Intranet (NMCI), the hazards faced by the possible compromise of these computer network systems are as great as any a fleet unit would encounter in its normal operating environment. The objective of this thesis is to translate ORM practices into Information Assurance Risk Management (IARM) practices, and demonstrate IARM's utility in identifying, quantifying, and mitigating the security risks associated with computer networks.","2001-03-01","http://books.google.es/books?id=dtFHAAAACAAJ&dq=intitle:risk%2Bintitle:network&hl=&cd=89&source=gbs_api","1423529472",

"A Neural Network-based Decision Support System for Identifying and Remediating At-risk Students in Developmental Mathematics","intitle:risk+intitle:network","[Cameron Ian Cooper]",,"Developmental mathematics courses at post-secondary institutions have high failure rates that cost institutions financially and students educationally. The resulting specific research questions of this study addressed whether an early warning decision support system based on neural networks and a supporting pedagogical initiative could reduce these failure rates. Using an experimental design, at-risk students at Fort Lewis College were randomly placed into treatment (n=22) and control (n=20) groups. The resultant neural network inputs were used to make managerial decisions regarding pedagogy for a weekly one-hour concurrent support class. Cohen's d for the treatment indicated an overall effect size of 0.43, a moderately strong effect for behavioral data. The results showed an 8% increase in student success rates between 2006 and 2007. This research contributes to the existing body of knowledge by uniquely combining neural network pruning processes to create a network that identifies at-risk students. The results also suggest that using motivational interviewing, addressing math anxiety, and tailoring the support course to the needs of the students are very beneficial for at-risk students. From a positive social perspective, beyond the potential improvement in the success rate of students in the field of mathematics, the results of this research may be regarded as a framework for additional early warning systems and means for informed pedagogical initiatives for other disciplines.","2007","http://books.google.es/books?id=VFsGuQAACAAJ&dq=intitle:risk%2Bintitle:network&hl=&cd=91&source=gbs_api","0549018999",

"Investment and Risk Management Analysis of Proactive as Against Reactive Network Maintenance","intitle:risk+intitle:network","[Lauri Forsman, Markku J. Penttinen]",,"Abstract: ""This study analyses the factors affecting investment decisions concerning end-user support (EUS), which is even more complex than that of centralised data processing (DP). The alternatives of proactive and reactive end-user support (EUS) in a modern LAN environment are compared by analysing the failure risk of one specific component (HUB) of the LAN. The additional preventive actions and management costs are considered as well. Both proactive and reactive EUS are analysed in terms of investment and risk management. Arguments for and against enhanced support capability and a fault tolerant system structure are sought for optimising risk/spending levels. The reliability theory with its demand patterns demonstrated by electronic components has been used in the spirit of inventory-production theory in order to quantify the risk both with deterministic and random failure intensity parameters. Exact Bayesian tests have been developed in order to evaluate the two vendor MTBF figures, only the first of which turns out to match the observation. Bayesian posterior failure distributions have been estimated both in the deterministic and random failure intensity cases, the last of which results in a binomial distribution with an annual mean of 16 HUBs and a standard deviation of 4 HUBs. The cost parameters estimated by NOKIA from the field have been used, and the costs of alternative policies have been assessed. The annual expected reactive cost, with a lower hourly developer cost option of kFIM 563, exceeds the annual proactive cost of kFIM 552. An additional investment, i.e. systems for network monitoring equipment of kFIM 210 with a three-year pay-back period can be recommended. However, the expected reactive cost would not carry the investment where proactive policy would require an additional management effort compared with the reactive one. The additional preventive actions, costing kFIM 672 annually, could be covered only by assuming that developer capacity is a sales-limiting factor. Recommendations and sensitivity considerations can easily be provided for the day-to-day decision-making of IT and SBU management, using the developed calculation models with updated cost and failure statistics data. A key notion of the study is to develop a management tool for NOKIA's DP management.""","1998","http://books.google.es/books?id=HRVnAAAACAAJ&dq=intitle:risk%2Bintitle:network&hl=&cd=93&source=gbs_api","9514444469",

First, there is evidence of out-of sample forecasting power for tail risk realizations of real activity for several countries, suggesting the usefulness of the model as a risk monitoring tool. Second, in all countries aggregate demand shocks are the main drivers of the real cycle, and bank credit demand shocks are the main drivers of the bank lending cycle.

"The Variation in the Structure of Risks Driving the Yield Curve. Implications for Bond Portfolio Choice","intitle:risks+intitle:structure","[He Zhang]",,"This paper presents the newly developed weight-parameterized portfolio policy to seek for an optimal portfolio of different bonds and investigates the predictability of macroeconomic factors for bond returns. The weight of each bond in the portfolio is directly modeled as a function of bonds' maturities and sensitivities to macroeconomic factors. A rolling regression approach is applied to obtain the sensitivities as characteristics of each bond which lead to the deviation from benchmark weight. Two forms of benchmark portfolio are discussed and compared. This article finds that the active optimal portfolio over-performs benchmark and the macroeconomic variables do affect the bond weight in optimal portfolio. Out-of-sample experiment shows little robustness in bond portfolio. Direct estimation with different risk aversion reveals investors with higher risk aversion tend to hold long-term bond.","2008","http://books.google.es/books?id=MwSjYgEACAAJ&dq=intitle:risks%2Bintitle:structure&hl=&cd=2&source=gbs_api","OCLC:611927341",

Burbidge]","[Philosophy]","John Burbidge shows that, far from incorporating everything into an all-consuming necessity, Hegel's philosophy requires the novelty of unexpected contingencies to maintain its systematic pretensions. To know without fear of failure is to expect that experience will confound our confident claims to knowledge. And the universal character of all life involves acting, discovering what happens as a result, and incorporating both intention and result into a new comprehensive understanding. Burbidge explores how Hegel applied this approach when he turned from his logic to chemistry, biology, psychology and history, and suggests how a Hegelian might function within the changed circumstances of contemporary science.","2007","http://books.google.es/books?id=FPLWAAAAMAAJ&dq=intitle:contingency%2Bintitle:systemic&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api","0230527523",

In particular, it focuses on the interplay between form and structure: the things that we might predict and model and the things that we cannot predict - the arbitrary and the contingent - which may be as important, or even more important, than the way in which life on earth has evolved. The contributors are drawn from palaeontology, archaeology, anthropology and human evolution; the time scales covered are from the development of life on earth, through human evolution to later prehistory and historic archaeology. Underpinning the theme of the book is the work of Stephen Jay Gould, who has developed a distinctive philosophy of history concerning the nature of long-term and short-term evolutionary processes, particularly stressing the interplay between structure and contingency.","1999-03-31","http://books.google.es/books?id=wjbPqlp3KqwC&printsec=frontcover&dq=intitle:contingency%2Bintitle:structure&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api","0718500261",

"A Perceptual Evaluation of the CONUS Installation Maintenance Support Structure by Application of the Contingency Theory of Management - An Exploratory Study","intitle:contingency+intitle:structure","[Luther J. Griffith]",,"This study was a perceptual evaluation of the CONUS installation maintenance support structure by application of the contingency theory of management. Decentralized maintenance support was evaluated against centralized support to determine the most efficient and effective concept for organizational structuring at installations in CONUS. The study concluded that centralization was the appropriate structural concept. As a result, a conceptual model was devised for structuring installation maintenance organizations that provided for centralized support of NON-TOE activities and TOE units.

"Establishment of a Permanent Joint Task Force Headquarters. An Analysis of Sourcing a Command and Control Structure Capable of Executing Forced Entry Contingency Operations","intitle:contingency+intitle:structure","[Michael L. Henchen]",,"This demise of the former Soviet Union, while bringing about the end to the Cold War, has not resulted in a concurrent decrease in regional military confrontations. In many respects, today's global environment is much more volatile and fragile than that of the bi-polar era. It is within this environment that the United States must remain poised and ready to rapidly project forced entry military capability. This study investigates and analyzes the current and projected capabilities of the U.S. military to establish and deploy a joint task force headquarters capable of planning and executing these complicated operations. Conclusions reached as a result of this study point to the need to permanently establish a single joint task force headquarters which can serve as a rapidly expanded nucleus for the designated JTF commander. This finding echoes that of Holloway Commission's 1980 report on the failure of the Iranian hostage rescue which found that an existing JTF organization, even if it were small and had few permanent members assigned, would provide an organization with the required expertise which could serve as the nucleus for a larger force upon activation.

"Extreme Point Methods in the Determination of the Structure of a Class of Bivariate Distributions and Some Applications to Contingency Tables","intitle:contingency+intitle:structure","[M. B. Rao, P. R. Krishnaiah, K. Subramanyam]",,"A decomposition of the class of all bivariate positive quadrant dependent distribution into compact convex subsets is obtained. Extreme points of these compact convex subsets are investigated. A similar decomposition works out for the class of all bivariate distributions. Extreme points of the compact convex sets figuring in this decomposition are analyzed. An application to contingency tables is presented.

"A Structure Theorem on Bivariate Positive Quadrant Dependent Distributions and Tests for Independence in Two-way Contingency Tables","intitle:contingency+intitle:structure","[M. Bhaskara Rao, Paruchuri Rama Krishnaiah, K. Subramanyam]",,"In this paper, the set of all bivariate positive quadrant dependent distributions with fixed marginals is shown to be compact and convex. Extreme points of this convex set are enumerated in some specific examples. Applications are given in testing the hypothesis of independence against strict positive quadrant dependence in the context of ordinal contingency tables. Various procedures based upon certain functions of the eigenvalues of a random matrix are also proposed for testing for independence in two-way contingency table. The performance of some tests one of which is based on eigenvalues of a random matrix is compared.","1985","http://books.google.es/books?id=Yqz7ygAACAAJ&dq=intitle:contingency%2Bintitle:structure&hl=&cd=26&source=gbs_api","OCLC:220342697",
