"Global Market Conditions and Systemic Risk","market+systemic+risk","[Brenda Gonzlez-Hermosillo, Heiko Hesse, Gonz&#x00E1, lez-Hermosillo, Brenda]","[Business & Economics]","This paper examines several key global market conditions, such as a proxy for market uncertainty and measures of interbank funding stress, to assess financial volatility and the likelihood of crisis. Using Markov regime-switching techniques, it shows that the Lehman Brothers failure was a watershed event in the crisis, although signs of heightened systemic risk could be detected as early as February 2007. In addition, we analyze the role of global market conditions to help determine when governments should begin to exit their extraordinary public support measures.","2009-10-01","http://books.google.es/books?id=tJg54uDm4YMC&printsec=frontcover&dq=market%2Bsystemic%2Brisk&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api","9781451917956",
"Market Discipline Under Systemic Risk. Evidence from Bank Runs in Emerging Economies","market+systemic+risk","[Eduardo Levy Yeyati, Maria Soledad Martinez Peria, Sergio L. Schmukler]","[Bank failures]","""Levy-Yeyati, Martinez Peria, and Schmukler show that systemic risk exerts a significant impact on the behavior of depositors, sometimes overshadowing their responses to standard bank fundamentals. Systemic risk can affect market discipline both regardless of and through bank fundamentals. First, worsening systemic conditions can directly threaten the value of deposits by way of dual agency problems. Second, to the extent that banks are exposed to systemic risk, systemic shocks lead to a future deterioration of fundamentals not captured by their current values. Using data from the recent banking crises in Argentina and Uruguay, the authors show that market discipline is indeed quite robust once systemic risk is factored in. As systemic risk increases, the informational content of past fundamentals declines. These episodes also show how few systemic shocks can trigger a run irrespective of ex-ante fundamentals. Overall, the evidence suggests that in emerging economies, the notion of market discipline needs to account for systemic risk. This paper--a product of the Finance Team, Development Research Group--is part of a larger effort in the group to study market discipline""--World Bank web site.","2004","http://books.google.es/books?id=Cx8z4mvVHYYC&printsec=frontcover&dq=market%2Bsystemic%2Brisk&hl=&cd=2&source=gbs_api","Market Discipline U",
"Systemic Contingent Claims Analysis – Estimating Market-Implied Systemic Risk","market+systemic+risk","[Mr. Andreas A. Jobst, Mr. Dale F. Gray]","[Business & Economics]","The recent global financial crisis has forced a re-examination of risk transmission in the financial sector and how it affects financial stability. Current macroprudential policy and surveillance (MPS) efforts are aimed establishing a regulatory framework that helps mitigate the risk from systemic linkages with a view towards enhancing the resilience of the financial sector. This paper presents a forward-looking framework (""Systemic CCA"") to measure systemic solvency risk based on market-implied expected losses of financial institutions with practical applications for the financial sector risk management and the system-wide capital assessment in top-down stress testing. The suggested approach uses advanced contingent claims analysis (CCA) to generate aggregate estimates of the joint default risk of multiple institutions as a conditional tail expectation using multivariate extreme value theory (EVT). In addition, the framework also helps quantify the individual contributions to systemic risk and contingent liabilities of the financial sector during times of stress.","2013-02-27","http://books.google.es/books?id=XhbYslQUfAgC&pg=PR12&dq=market%2Bsystemic%2Brisk&hl=&cd=3&source=gbs_api","9781475557534",
"Collateral, Netting and Systemic Risk in the Otc Derivatives Market","market+systemic+risk","[Manmohan Singh]","[Business & Economics]","To mitigate systemic risk, some regulators have advocated the greater use of centralized counterparties (CCPs) to clear Over-The-Counter (OTC) derivatives trades. Regulators should be cognizant that large banks active in the OTC derivatives market do not hold collateral against all the positions in their trading book and the paper proves an estimate of this under-collateralization. Whatever collateral is held by banks is allowed to be rehypothecated (or re-used) to others. Since CCPs would require all positions to have collateral against them, off-loading a significant portion of OTC derivatives transactions to central counterparties (CCPs) would require large increases in posted collateral, possibly requiring large banks to raise more capital. These costs suggest that most large banks will be reluctant to offload their positions to CCPs, and the paper proposes an appropriate capital levy on remaining positions to encourage the transition.","2010-04-01","http://books.google.es/books?id=10JrdHH3XBAC&printsec=frontcover&dq=market%2Bsystemic%2Brisk&hl=&cd=4&source=gbs_api","9781451982855",

Recent events suggest that older models of systemic shocks might no longer capture all of the possible paths of such disturbances or account for the increasing complexity of the financial system. To help assess these concerns, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and the NRC cosponsored a conference that brought together engineers, scientists, economists, and financial market experts to promote better understanding of systemic risk in a variety of fields. The book presents an examination of tools used in ecology and engineering to study systemic collapse in those areas; a review of current trends in economic research on systemic risk, the payments system, and the market of interbank funds; and for context, descriptions of how systemic risk in the financial system affects trading activities.","2007-12-31","http://books.google.es/books?id=1jGlL5OFf2oC&pg=PT16&dq=market%2Bsystemic%2Brisk&hl=&cd=6&source=gbs_api","030917953X",
"Systemic Risk from Global Financial Derivatives: A Network Analysis of Contagion and Its Mitigation with Super-Spreader Tax","market+systemic+risk","[Ms. Sheri M. Markose]","[Business & Economics]","Financial network analysis is used to provide firm level bottom-up holistic visualizations of interconnections of financial obligations in global OTC derivatives markets. This helps to identify Systemically Important Financial Intermediaries (SIFIs), analyse the nature of contagion propagation, and also monitor and design ways of increasing robustness in the network. Based on 2009 FDIC and individually collected firm level data covering gross notional, gross positive (negative) fair value and the netted derivatives assets and liabilities for 202 financial firms which includes 20 SIFIs, the bilateral flows are empirically calibrated to reflect data-based constraints. This produces a tiered network with a distinct highly clustered central core of 12 SIFIs that account for 78 percent of all bilateral exposures and a large number of financial intermediaries (FIs) on the periphery. The topology of the network results in the “Too- Interconnected-To-Fail” (TITF) phenomenon in that the failure of any member of the central tier will bring down other members with the contagion coming to an abrupt end when the ‘super-spreaders’ have demised. As these SIFIs account for the bulk of capital in the system, ipso facto no bank among the top tier can be allowed to fail, highlighting the untenable implicit socialized guarantees needed for these markets to operate at their current levels. Systemic risk costs of highly connected SIFIs nodes are not priced into their holding of capital or collateral. An eigenvector centrality based ‘super-spreader’ tax has been designed and tested for its capacity to reduce the potential socialized losses from failure of SIFIs.","2012-11-30","http://books.google.es/books?id=u9SqWVbez-AC&pg=PT19&dq=market%2Bsystemic%2Brisk&hl=&cd=7&source=gbs_api","9781475531862",

Historically, government insurance programs tend to be ineffective at segregating risks, leading to markets that are inefficient. In the case of the Federal Crop Insurance program, rates are set non-competitively. This study develops a spatial econometric model of loss experience and finds evidence of geographic misratings.

"Quantifying Systemic Risk","market+systemic+risk","[Joseph G. Haubrich, Andrew W. Lo]","[Business & Economics]","In the aftermath of the recent financial crisis, the federal government has pursued significant regulatory reforms, including proposals to measure and monitor systemic risk. However, there is much debate about how this might be accomplished quantitatively and objectively—or whether this is even possible. A key issue is determining the appropriate trade-offs between risk and reward from a policy and social welfare perspective given the potential negative impact of crises. One of the first books to address the challenges of measuring statistical risk from a system-wide persepective, Quantifying Systemic Risk looks at the means of measuring systemic risk and explores alternative approaches. Among the topics discussed are the challenges of tying regulations to specific quantitative measures, the effects of learning and adaptation on the evolution of the market, and the distinction between the shocks that start a crisis and the mechanisms that enable it to grow.","2013-01-24","http://books.google.es/books?id=cemEjRqwXFwC&printsec=frontcover&dq=market%2Bsystemic%2Brisk&hl=&cd=16&source=gbs_api","0226921964",
"Systemic Liquidity Risk and Bipolar Markets. Wealth Management in Today's Macro Risk On / Risk Off Financial Environment","market+systemic+risk","[Clive M. Corcoran]","[Business & Economics]","The dramatic and well chronicled crisis of 2007/8 marked a watershed moment for all stakeholders in global capital markets. In the aftermath, financial markets have become even more tightly coupled as correlations in returns across multiple asset classes have been at historically elevated levels. Investors and fund managers are, to a much larger degree than previously and often much more than they realize, subject to the risk of severe wealth destruction. The ultimate hazard, which is not adequately characterized by the widely touted notion of tail risk, is the systemic risk which arises when liquidity in markets completely evaporates. Not only did this happen in the second half of 2008, but it has been repeated episodically since then – most notably in May 2010, in an incident known as the Flash Crash, and in the fall of 2011 when correlations were at historically elevated levels. Conventional asset allocation tools and techniques have failed to keep apace with the changing financial landscape which has emerged since 2008. In addition to the preponderance of algorithmic trading and the associated changes in the liquidity characteristics of financial markets, a new paradigm of risk on/risk off asset allocation has emerged. Risk on/risk off is a widely adopted style of trading and macro allocation strategy where positions are taken in several closely aligned asset classes depending on the prevailing sentiment or appetite for risk. The consequences of the day to day (and intraday) switching between either a risk on or risk off tactical strategies poses significant new challenges to investors who are still making investment decisions with outmoded notions from traditional asset allocation theory. How can one cushion the impact of systemically threatening events when the ability to exit financial instruments becomes almost non existent? How can one trust the integrity of financial models and orthodox macro financial theory which have become increasingly discredited? Can central bankers be relied upon to become the counter-parties of last resort and provide a safety net under the financial system? These vital questions, and many others, need to be addressed by everyone who has a stake in modern financial markets, and they are addressed in Systemic Liquidity Risk and Bipolar Markets. Proper functioning markets require fractiousness or divided opinion, and this needs to be lubricated by communications from central bankers, economic forecasters, corporate executives and so on. As long as such messages and market conditions remain ambiguous, providing asymmetric information to different market players, then the conditions are present to enable systemic liquidity to be preserved. Seen in this context the prevailing paradigm of bipolar risk on/risk off asset allocations is both a prerequisite to liquid markets, and also paradoxically, when one side of the polarity becomes too extreme, a major source of systemic instability. Should such polarities become critically unbalanced, and should the signals received by market players become symmetrically disadvantageous as they were in the fall of 2008, then an even more substantial systemic liquidity crisis than that seen in those troubled times is a dangerous possibility. Apart from the practical risk management tools and tactics that are recommended in Systemic Liquidity Risk and Bipolar Markets, there is a provocative and cogent narrative to provide anxious and perplexed investors with a coherent explanation of the post GFC financial environment, and which should assist them in navigating the choppy waters ahead.","2012-11-26","http://books.google.es/books?id=Xa68Z0He1tYC&printsec=frontcover&dq=market%2Bsystemic%2Brisk&hl=&cd=17&source=gbs_api","9781118410752",

"Australia: Addressing Systemic Risk Through Higher Loss Absorbency—Technical Note","market+systemic+risk","[International Monetary Fund]","[Business & Economics]","Australia’s four largest banks can be considered domestically systemic. They make up the lion’s share of the banking system, use similar business models, and are interconnected. The top four banks are relatively similar in terms of systemic importance, partly reflecting the authorities’ ?four pillar? policy, which aims at preventing the number of large banks from falling below four. To deal with systemic risks, the authorities deploy a multi-pronged approach consisting of risk-based supervision, recovery and resolution planning, and conservative risk weights and definitions of loss absorbent capital. Most countries that have already identified strategies to deal with their systemic institutions incorporate higher loss absorbency for systemic institutions in their approach. Market based methodologies using the expected default frequency for systemic institutions can gauge the amount of additional capital—higher loss absorbency—required to reduce the probability of failure of systemic institutions to an acceptable level. Alternatively, the implied funding cost advantage can indicate the degree of systemic importance and be used to define higher capital requirements to offset this implicit subsidy. Application of these methods to Australian banks provides a range of estimates of higher loss absorbency requirements for systemic institutions and a transparent framework for discussion and selection of these requirements.","2012-11-21","http://books.google.es/books?id=B3rD-a5rQgsC&printsec=frontcover&dq=market%2Bsystemic%2Brisk&hl=&cd=19&source=gbs_api","9781616358242",

"Technical Capabilities Necessary for Systemic Risk Regulation. Summary of a Workshop","market+systemic+risk","[Board on Mathematical Sciences and Their Applications, Division on Engineering and Physical Sciences, National Research Council]","[Business & Economics]","The financial reform plans currently under discussion in the United States recognize the need for monitoring and regulating systemic risk in the financial sector. To inform those discussions, the National Research Council held a workshop on November 3, 2009, to identify the major technical challenges to building such a capability. The workshop, summarized in this volume, addressed the following key issues as they relate to systemic risk: What data and analytical tools are currently available to regulators to address this challenge? What further data-collection and data-analysis capabilities are needed? What specific resource needs are required to accomplish the task? What are the major technical challenges associated with systemic risk regulation? What are various options for building these capabilities? Because every systemic event is unique with respect to its specific pathology--the various triggers and the propagation of effects--the workshop focused on the issues listed above for systemic risk in general rather than for any specific scenario. Thus, by design, the workshop explicitly addressed neither the causes of the current crisis nor policy options for reducing risk, and it attempted to steer clear of some policy issues altogether (such as how to allocate new supervisory responsibilities). More than 40 experts representing diverse perspectives participated in the workshop.","2010-01-19","http://books.google.es/books?id=4zFkAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA7&dq=market%2Bsystemic%2Brisk&hl=&cd=21&source=gbs_api","9780309149600",

"Engineering the Financial Crisis. Systemic Risk and the Failure of Regulation","market+systemic+risk","[Jeffrey Friedman, Wladimir Kraus]","[Business & Economics]","The financial crisis has been blamed on reckless bankers, irrational exuberance, government support of mortgages for the poor, financial deregulation, and expansionary monetary policy. Specialists in banking, however, tell a story with less emotional resonance but a better correspondence to the evidence: the crisis was sparked by the international regulatory accords on bank capital levels, the Basel Accords. In one of the first studies critically to examine the Basel Accords, Engineering the Financial Crisis reveals the crucial role that bank capital requirements and other government regulations played in the recent financial crisis. Jeffrey Friedman and Wladimir Kraus argue that by encouraging banks to invest in highly rated mortgage-backed bonds, the Basel Accords created an overconcentration of risk in the banking industry. In addition, accounting regulations required banks to reduce lending if the temporary market value of these bonds declined, as they did in 2007 and 2008 during the panic over subprime mortgage defaults. The book begins by assessing leading theories about the crisis—deregulation, bank compensation practices, excessive leverage, ""too big to fail,"" and Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac—and, through careful evidentiary scrutiny, debunks much of the conventional wisdom about what went wrong. It then discusses the Basel Accords and how they contributed to systemic risk. Finally, it presents an analysis of social-science expertise and the fallibility of economists and regulators. Engagingly written, theoretically inventive, yet empirically grounded, Engineering the Financial Crisis is a timely examination of the unintended—and sometimes disastrous—effects of regulation on complex economies.","2011-09-01","http://books.google.es/books?id=73EUJAMpfxYC&printsec=frontcover&dq=market%2Bsystemic%2Brisk&hl=&cd=27&source=gbs_api","9780812205077",

As such, understanding and controlling systemic risk has become an extremely important societal and economic challenge. The Econophys-Kolkata VI conference proceedings are dedicated to addressing a number of key issues involved. Several leading researchers in these fields report on their recent work and also review contemporary literature on the subject.","2012-08-08","http://books.google.es/books?id=ZaFnDCIynisC&printsec=frontcover&dq=market%2Bsystemic%2Brisk&hl=&cd=29&source=gbs_api","9788847025530",
"The Systemic Regulation of Credit Rating Agencies and Rated Markets (EPub)","market+systemic+risk","[Mr. Amadou N. R. Sy]","[Business & Economics]","Credit ratings have contributed to the current financial crisis. Proposals to regulate credit rating agencies focus on micro-prudential issues and aim at reducing conflicts of interest and increasing transparency and competition. In contrast, this paper argues that macro-prudential regulation is necessary to address the systemic risk inherent to ratings. The paper illustrates how financial markets have increasingly relied on ratings. It shows how downgrades have led to systemic market losses and increased illiquidity. The paper suggests the use of ""ratings maps"" and stress-tests to assess the systemic risk of ratings, and increased capital or liquidity buffers to manage such risk.","2009-06-01","http://books.google.es/books?id=oeyKx-WgbvQC&pg=PP9&dq=market%2Bsystemic%2Brisk&hl=&cd=30&source=gbs_api","9781452765204",
"The Future of Futures. The Time of Money in Financing and Society","market+systemic+risk","[Elena Esposito]","[Business & Economics]","'Within the cacophony of voices trying to explain the recent financial crisis, Elena Esposito's voice sounds clear and deep. Steering away from simplistic condemnations and equally simplistic prescriptions for betterment, she connects the very invention of derivatives to that eternal human hope – of controlling the future. While the task is impossible, the attempts never stop, and the very process of attempting it brings some consolation. And while derivatives can be seen, claim sociologists of finance, as performative, that is shaping the future they promise to control, even this is far from certain. Esposito's fascinating and beautiful work is an important contribution to the sociology of finance, a subdiscipline of sociology that took on itself an extremely important task of explaining how the finance markets really work.'– Barbara Czarniawska, University of Gothenburg, Sweden'This is a brilliant and timely book that shows how financing is centrally implicated in the very unpredictability and uncertainty it purports to master. With the incisiveness characteristic of her style and writing, Esposito reads economics in innovative ways that disclose the hidden premises by which financial instruments trade and consume the prospects of the future.' – Jannis Kallinikos, London School of Economics, UK'Elena Esposito's analysis of financial markets and of their recent decline is radically different from the analyses which can be found in economic journals or books. Financial operations are reduced to their basic dimensions: time and money. Under this perspective, what is sold on financial markets is the possibility for the creation of commitments in the course of time, the possibility for the combination of these commitments with one another, and the identification of chances for the achievement of profit opportunities through the creation of specific combinations. The author argues that the recent crisis of the financial system was caused by oversimplified visions of the future and of risk leading to the consequence that options were not available in the present because all possibilities had been used up by the future. This oversimplified vision of the future imploded, and trust with it. The state tried to reconstruct options for the future in order to open up new possibilities and chances for learning. The author does not deliver recipes on how to prevent severe crises of the financial system in the future. Yet, her concept facilitates understanding of how financial futures are opened up or closed and thus provides insights into basic principles on whose basis future opportunities can be kept open and trust can be maintained. Innovative reforms of the financial system can only develop on the basis of unconventional analyses. Elena Esposito's book contains an analysis of this kind.'– Alfred Kieser, Mannheim University, Germany'Elena Esposito's book is a fundamental analysis of time in economics. With economic rigour underpinned by sociological reasoning, she explains the futures market more clearly than is possible with economic analysis alone. Economic concepts are considered in terms of time – actors deal in the present with future risks by transferring these risks to the present situation. As a result, we get more options and more risks at the same time: at present. No equilibrium will balance these trades because of the asymmetry of time: our actual decisions deal with our imagination of the future, that is, with the future of the present, but the results will be realized in the presence of the future – different modalities of time. The book is a sound reflection on modelling time in economic theory, a ""must"" for economists.'– Birger P. Priddat, Witten/Herdecke University, Germany'The Future of Futures is an original and intellectually provocative book which forces the reader to think. Esposito's essay fulfils two rather different functions. On the one hand, it brings new and persuasive arguments to bear against the erroneous thesis that the present financial crisis is merely due to human mistakes and to some specific government failures. On the other hand, the book suggests that only by reconsidering the role of time in the economy is it possible to make full sense of the crisis and to re-orient in a desired direction the future movements of money. It is a well-known fact that traditional economics has always adhered to a spatial conception of time, according to which time, like space, is perfectly reversible. Whence its inability both to understand how economies develop and to prescribe adequate policies. The author's proposal is to move steps ahead in the direction of an analysis of an economy in time, where both historical time and time as duration can find a place. Esposito's well-written, jargon-free book will capture the attention of anyone seriously interested in the future of our market systems.'– Stefano Zamagni, University of Bologna and Johns Hopkins University, Bologna Center, Italy This book reconstructs the dynamics of economics, beginning explicitly with the role and the relevance of time: money uses the future in order to generate present wealth. Financial markets sell and buy risk, thereby binding the future. Elena Esposito explains that complex risk management techniques of structured finance produce new and uncontrolled risks because they use a simplified idea of the future, failing to account for how the future reacts to attempts at controlling it. During the recent financial crisis, the future had already been used (through securitizations, derivatives and other tools) to the extent that we had many futures, but no open future available.","2011-01-01","http://books.google.es/books?id=dqVxR1ZrDwcC&pg=PA83&dq=market%2Bsystemic%2Brisk&hl=&cd=31&source=gbs_api","9781849809115",

"Systemic Risk and Financial Consolidation. Are They Related?","market+systemic+risk","[Gianni De Nicoló, Myron L.

We find a positive trend in stock return correlations net of diversification effects for a sample of U.S. Large and Complex Banking Organizations over 1988-99. This finding suggests that the systemic risk potential in the financial sector may have increased. In addition, we find a positive consolidation elasticity of correlations. However, such elasticity exhibits substantial time variation and likely declined in the latter part of the decade. Thus, factors other than consolidation have also been responsible for the upward trend in return correlations.","2002-03-01","http://books.google.es/books?id=SWNHh_bDOncC&pg=PA15&dq=market%2Bsystemic%2Brisk&hl=&cd=37&source=gbs_api","9781451894479",

"The Risks of Financial Institutions","market+systemic+risk","[Mark Carey, René M.

Since then, however, a series of events—such as emerging-market debt crises, bond-market meltdowns, and the Long-Term Capital Management episode—has forced a rethinking of the risks facing financial institutions and the tools available to measure and manage these risks. The Risks of Financial Institutions examines the various risks affecting financial institutions and explores a variety of methods to help institutions and regulators more accurately measure and forecast risk. The contributors--from academic institutions, regulatory organizations, and banking--bring a wide range of perspectives and experience to the issue. The result is a volume that points a way forward to greater financial stability and better risk management of financial institutions.","2007-11-01","http://books.google.es/books?id=mTWtpwkGYGgC&pg=PA356&dq=market%2Bsystemic%2Brisk&hl=&cd=40&source=gbs_api","9780226092980",

A probabilistic method is used to capture and generalise from the local harmonic movement of a corpus of seventeenth-century dance music. The probabilistic grammars so generated are then used for experiments in generation (composition). The corpus is preprocessed in a novel way, automatically converting the harmonies into a normal form to capture the underlying harmonic similarities between pieces. It is then automatically marked up with constituent boundaries (beginnings and ends of pieces, phrases and bars), to enable the learning process to capture some of the higher-level structure of the music.

"The Timecourse of Learning Musical Structure","""statistical learning of""","[Erin McMullen Jonaitis]",,"The acquisition of musical expectations relates in part to listener abstraction of serial and distributional pitch information. However, previous research indicates that to learn a novel system, listeners may need multiple experiences spaced in time. In this experiment, we investigated the relative role for sleep, elapsed time, and re-exposure in this process. Participants visited the laboratory three times, spaced by twelve hours, each time listening to a corpus of chord sequences constructed according to an artificial grammar. Listeners completed two additional tasks at each session: a similarity-rating task tapping sensitivity to chord transitions, and a probe tone task examining key perception. Start times were staggered to allow comparison of post-sleep versus post-wake performance while minimizing any circadian-rhythm confound. In the chord transition task, listeners were unable to differentiate correct from error items at the end of the first session, but by the beginning of the second session (before re-exposure), discrimination emerged. In the probe tone task, some experienced listeners' performance indicated sensitivity to the novel distributional structure; however, no clear effect of the passage of time was found. No sleep-dependent effect was observed in either dataset. We situate these findings in the recent literature on off-line learning and propose that the lack of sleep dependence may relate to the implicit nature of the tasks.","2008","http://books.google.es/books?id=nxLbGDlXnOUC&pg=PA37&dq=%22statistical+learning+of%22&hl=&cd=14&source=gbs_api","0549634495",

"Learning and the Infant Mind","""statistical learning of""","[Amanda Woodward, Amy Needham]","[Education]","When asking how cognition comes to take its mature form, learning seems to be an obvious factor to consider. However, until quite recently, there has been very little contact between investigations of how infants learn and what infants know. For example, on the one hand, research efforts focused on infants' foundational conceptual knowledge-what they know about the physical permanence of objects, causal relations, and human intentions-often do not consider how learning may contribute to the structure of this knowledge. On the other hand, research efforts focused on infants' perceptual and motor learning-how they extract information from the environment, tune their behavior patterns according to this information, and generalize learning to new situations-often do not consider the potential impacts of these perceptual and learning mechanisms the structure of conceptual knowledge. Although each of these research efforts has made significant progress, this research has done little to narrow the divide between the disparate traditions of learning and knowledge. The chapters in this book document, for the first time, the insights that emerge when researchers who come from diverse domains and use different approaches make a genuine attempt to bridge this divide. The authors consider both infants' knowledge across domains, including knowledge of objects, physical relations between objects, categories, people, and language, and learning broadly construed, bringing to bear direct laboratory manipulations of learning and more general considerations of the relations between experience and knowledge. These authors have begun to consider whether and how the products of learning ""go beyond"" the input in several senses. As a result, several converging trends emerge across Whese diverse points of view. These authors have begun to investigate whether infants derive relatively abstract representations from experience, as well as the extent to which infants generalize information learned in one context to a new context. They have also begun to investigate the extent to which learning is generative, constraining and informing subsequent learning.","2009","http://books.google.es/books?id=_6GfAAAAMAAJ&q=%22statistical+learning+of%22&dq=%22statistical+learning+of%22&hl=&cd=22&source=gbs_api","UOM:39015074064190",

"Simulator-based Human Factors Studies Across 25 Years. The History of the Halden Man-Machine Laboratory","simulation+power+plant+design","[Ann Britt Skjerve, Andreas Bye]","[Business & Economics]","The Halden Man-Machine Laboratory (HAMMLAB) has been at the heart of human factors research at the OECD Halden Reactor Project (HRP). The HRP is sponsored by a group of organizations representing nuclear power plant regulators, utilities, research institutions and vendors. The HRP is hosted by the Institute for Energy Technology (IFE) in Halden, Norway. HAMMLAB comprises three full-scale nuclear power plant control room research simulators. The simulator studies performed in HAMMLAB have traditionally been experimental in nature. In a simulator it is possible to study events as they unfold in real time, in a highly realistic operational environment under partially controlled conditions. This means that a wide range of human factors issues, which would be impossible or highly impracticable to study in real-life settings, can thus be addressed in HAMMLAB. Simulator-based Human Factors Studies Across 25 Years celebrates the twenty-fifth anniversary of HAMMLAB by reviewing the human factors studies performed in HAMMLAB across this time-span. A range of human factors issues have been addressed, including: • human-system interfaces; • alarm systems; • computerized procedures; • human-automation interaction; • staffing and teamwork; and • human reliability. The aim of HAMMLAB studies has always been the same: to generate knowledge for solving current and future challenges in nuclear power plant operation to contribute to safety. The outcomes of HAMMLAB studies have been used to support design and assessment of nuclear power plant control rooms.","2010-12-07","http://books.google.es/books?id=NQgVAaVlccQC&pg=PR7&dq=simulation%2Bpower%2Bplant%2Bdesign&hl=&cd=28&source=gbs_api","0857290037",
"Power Plant Life Management and Performance Improvement","simulation+power+plant+design","[J E Oakey]","[Technology & Engineering]","Coal- and gas-based power plants currently supply the largest proportion of the world’s power generation capacity, and are required to operate to increasingly stringent environmental standards. Higher temperature combustion is therefore being adopted to improve plant efficiency and to maintain net power output given the energy penalty that integration of advanced emissions control systems cause. However, such operating regimes also serve to intensify degradation mechanisms within power plant systems, potentially affecting their reliability and lifespan. Power plant life management and performance improvement critically reviews the fundamental degradation mechanisms that affect conventional power plant systems and components, as well as examining the operation and maintenance approaches and advanced plant rejuvenation and retrofit options that the industry are applying to ensure overall plant performance improvement and life management. Part one initially reviews plant operation issues, including fuel flexibility, condition monitoring and performance assessment. Parts two, three and four focus on coal boiler plant, gas turbine plant, and steam boiler and turbine plant respectively, reviewing environmental degradation mechanisms affecting plant components and their mitigation via advances in materials selection and life management approaches, such as repair, refurbishment and upgrade. Finally, part five reviews issues relevant to the performance management and improvement of advanced heat exchangers and power plant welds. With its distinguished editor and international team of contributors, Power plant life management and performance improvement is an essential reference for power plant operators, industrial engineers and metallurgists, and researchers interested in this important field.

"Design and Safety Assessment of Critical Systems","simulation+power+plant+design","[Marco Bozzano, Adolfo Villafiorita]","[Computers]","Safety-critical systems, by definition those systems whose failure can cause catastrophic results for people, the environment, and the economy, are becoming increasingly complex both in their functionality and their interactions with the environment. Unfortunately, safety assessments are still largely done manually, a time-consuming and error-prone process. The growing complexity of these systems requires an increase in the skill and efficacy of safety engineers and encourages the adoption of formal and standardized techniques. An introduction to the area of design and verification of safety-critical systems, Design and Safety Assessment of Critical Systems focuses on safety assessment using formal methods. Beginning with an introduction to the fundamental concepts of safety and reliability, it illustrates the pivotal issues of design, development, and safety assessment of critical systems. The core of the book covers traditional notations, techniques, and procedures, including Fault Tree Analysis, FMECA, HAZOP, and Event Tree Analysis, and explains in detail how formal methods can be used to realize such procedures. It looks at the development process of safety-critical systems, and highlights influential management and organizational aspects. Finally, it describes verification and validation techniques and new trends in formal methods for safety and concludes with some widely adopted standards for the certification of safety-critical systems. Providing an in-depth and hands-on view of the application of formal techniques to advanced and critical safety assessments in a variety of industrial sectors, such as transportation, avionics and aerospace, and nuclear power, Design and Safety Assessment of Critical Systems allows anyone with a basic background in mathematics or computer science to move confidently into this advanced arena of safety assessment.","2010-12-12","http://books.google.es/books?id=Mhrb8NevKsIC&pg=PA161&dq=simulation%2Bpower%2Bplant%2Bdesign&hl=&cd=30&source=gbs_api","9781439803325",

"Applications of Statistics and Probability in Civil Engineering","civil+engineering+impacts","[Michael Faber, Jochen Koehler, Kazuyoshi Nishijima]","[Technology & Engineering]","Under the pressure of harsh environmental conditions and natural hazards, large parts of the world population are struggling to maintain their livelihoods. Population growth, increasing land utilization and shrinking natural resources have led to an increasing demand of improved efficiency of existing technologies and the development of new ones. Additionally, growing complexities of societal functionalities and interdependencies among infrastructures and urban habitats amplify consequences of malfunctions and failures. Malevolence, sustainable developments and climatic changes have more recently been added to the list of challenges. Over the last decades, substantial progress has been made in assessing and quantifying risks. However, with regard to the broader utilization of risk assessment as a means for societal strategic and operational planning, there is still a great need for further development. Applications of Statistics and Probability in Civil Engineering contains the proceedings of the 11th International Conference on Applications of Statistics and Probability in Civil Engineering (ICASP11, Zürich, Switzerland, 1-4 August 2011). The book focuses not only on the more traditional technical issues, but also emphasizes the societal context of the decision making problems including the interaction between stakeholders. This holistic perspective supports the enhanced and sustainable allocation of limited resources for the improvement of safety, environment and economy. The book is of interest to researchers and scientists working in the field of risk and reliability in engineering; to professionals and engineers, including insurance and consulting companies working with natural hazards, design, operation and maintenance of civil engineering and industrial facilities; and to decision makers and professionals in the public sector, including nongovernmental organisations responsible for risk management in the public domain, e.g. building authorities, the health and safety executives, the United Nations and the World Economic Forum.","2011-07-15","http://books.google.es/books?id=2K_7PmoiOxsC&pg=PA869&dq=civil%2Bengineering%2Bimpacts&hl=&cd=18&source=gbs_api","0415669863",

Water resource management in the river's watershed is the responsibility of the St. Johns River Water Management District (the District). The District must provide water for the region's 4.4 million residents as well as numerous industrial and agricultural users, all while protecting natural systems within the river basin. With population growth in the watershed expected to surpass 7.2 million in 2030, the District, through its water resources planning process, has begun to identify alternative sources of water beyond its traditional groundwater sources, including the potential withdrawal of 262 million gallons per day from the St. Johns River. To more comprehensively evaluate the environmental impacts of withdrawing this water from the river, the District embarked on a two-year Water Supply Impact Study (WSIS), and requested the involvement of the National Research Council.

Traditionally thought to be an activity exclusive to scientific researchers at large universities, grant proposal writing is now common among faculty in the social sciences, humanities and the arts. Small non-research institutions such as community colleges and four-year liberal arts colleges are pursuing grants to supplement shrinking revenues. Hundreds, perhaps thousands, of ""how to"" books and manuals exist to teach novices how to write grant proposals; however, very few studies investigate grant proposals as persuasive writing. My thesis will establish groundwork for further research on the rhetorical and organizational features that make up successful and unsuccessful grant proposals, and how knowledge of these features can benefit grant writers and the institutions they serve.","2008","http://books.google.es/books?id=dCEkQb4M8RwC&pg=PA18&dq=civil%2Bengineering%2Bimpacts&hl=&cd=40&source=gbs_api","054951760X",

Starting with the construction of Brownian motion, the book then proceeds to sample path properties like continuity and nowhere differentiability. Notions of fractal dimension are introduced early and are used throughout the book to describe fine properties of Brownian paths. The relation of Brownian motion and random walk is explored from several viewpoints, including a development of the theory of Brownian local times from random walk embeddings. Stochastic integration is introduced as a tool and an accessible treatment of the potential theory of Brownian motion clears the path for an extensive treatment of intersections of Brownian paths. An investigation of exceptional points on the Brownian path and an appendix on SLE processes, by Oded Schramm and Wendelin Werner, lead directly to recent research themes.","2010-03-25","http://books.google.es/books?id=e-TbA-dSrzYC&printsec=frontcover&dq=%22brownian+motion+theory%22&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api","9781139486576",

"Fluctuations of MIMO Wireless Channels. Analysis Based on Brownian Motion Theory","""brownian motion theory""","[Ping-Heng Kuo]","[Computers]","Multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) communication technology has the potential to resolve the bottleneck in traffic capacity for future wireless networks. Applying MIMO techniques to mobile communication systems, the problem of channel fading between the transmitters and receivers, which results in received signal strength fluctuations, is inevitable. This book provides some analytical methodologies to investigate the variation of MIMO channels, based on some mathematical results of Brownian motion. In particular, accurate analytical approximations for the level crossing rate (LCR) and average fade duration (AFD) of the several MIMO channel metrics are derived. Also, the temporal behavior of MIMO channels is studied via Markov model constructions. In addition, the instantaneous signal to interference plus noise ratio (SINR) of eigenmode transmission with a feedback time delay is analyzed. Finally, the fluctuation of the channel in the frequency domain is examined due to its practical importance in orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) systems.","2008","http://books.google.es/books?id=KvHbPQAACAAJ&dq=%22brownian+motion+theory%22&hl=&cd=5&source=gbs_api","3836450712",

The Conference Proceedings was published by the American Institute of Physics, Vol. 861, pp. 524-531.-------------------------------------------------------------------In 1905, Albert Einstein's theory of Brownian motion made a monumental contribution to thermodynamics. Specifically, the theory accounted for the rate of change of the particle momentum associated with thermal motion to study the diffusion of suspended particles in liquids. In this book, the author shows that Einstein's procedure is justified, not only for this particular problem, but for thermodynamic systems generally, including those containing surfaces, membranes, junctions phase boundaries and other interfacesThe resulting, new thermodynamic theory has unified the theory of semiconductor diodes and solar cells. Theoretical results have accurately corroborated experimental data reported by more than 25 authors over a period exceeding a quarter century. The new general theory has revealed that to simultaneously satisfy the first and second laws of thermodynamics, electric charges have to reside at most interfaces. This novel result is the first thermodynamic confirmation of Newton's speculation that capillarity and other interfacial phenomena involve electric forces. Interfacial electrification has explained numerous phenomena of interdisciplinary interest such as: surface tension, capillarity, drop coalescence, adhesion of light particles to surfaces, the separation of charges upon phase change, fog and cloud suspension, the origin of atmospheric electricity, and the generation of static electricity, to mention a few examples.The book provides ideas and results that will stimulate theoretical and applied research in a variety of disciplines.

"Option Pricing in Fractional Brownian Markets","""brownian motion theory""","[Stefan Rostek]","[Business & Economics]","The scientific debate of recent years about option pricing with respect to fractional Brownian motion was focused on the feasibility of the no arbitrage pricing approach. As the unrestricted fractional market setting allows for arbitrage, the conventional reasoning is that fractional Brownian motion does not qualify for modeling price process. In this book, the author points out that arbitrage can only be excluded in case that market prices move at least slightly faster than any market participant can react. He clarifies that continuous tradability always eliminates the risk of the fractional price process, irrespective of the interpretation of the stochastic integral as an integral of Stratonovich or Itô type. Being left with an incomplete market setting, the author shows that option valuation with respect to fractional Brownian motion may be solved by applying a risk preference based approach. The latter provides us with an intuitive closed-form solution for European options within the fractional context.","2009-04-28","http://books.google.es/books?id=bVdFRBljLyAC&pg=PA135&dq=%22brownian+motion+theory%22&hl=&cd=23&source=gbs_api","9783642003318",

The past several decades especially have witnessed an ever accelerating pace of research. This increase is due in large part to the development of new techniques for the analysis of brain and behavior. But, to a greater extent, these advances have been fueled by some seminal findings and the accumulation of knowledge based on systematic inquiry in many laboratories around the world. This important volume, authored by internationally renowned leaders in the field, is a progress report on this burgeoning work. What processes underlie the formation of new memories? What determines their strength? Where are the changes underlying memory located? In judging recent progress, this book looks at what we have learned about each of these questions. Furthermore, the contributors look at how these questions are rephrased and refined by new findings, hypotheses, and theories. Topics include: emotion and memory, aging and memory, plasticity of the cerebral cortex, and synaptic connectivity and memory. This book will be welcomed by neuroscientists, cognitive psychologists, and cognitive scientists.","1995-02-21","http://books.google.es/books?id=ThIPEM9c_9MC&printsec=frontcover&dq=neuroplasticity%2Bbrain&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api","0195344790",
"The Mind and the Brain","neuroplasticity+brain","[Jeffrey M. Schwartz, Sharon Begley]","[Science]","A groundbreaking work of science that confirms, for the first time, the independent existence of the mind–and demonstrates the possibilities for human control over the workings of the brain. Conventional science has long held the position that 'the mind' is merely an illusion, a side effect of electrochemical activity in the physical brain. Now in paperback, Dr Jeffrey Schwartz and Sharon Begley's groundbreaking work, The Mind and the Brain, argues exactly the opposite: that the mind has a life of its own.Dr Schwartz, a leading researcher in brain dysfunctions, and Wall Street Journal science columnist Sharon Begley demonstrate that the human mind is an independent entity that can shape and control the functioning of the physical brain. Their work has its basis in our emerging understanding of adult neuroplasticity–the brain's ability to be rewired not just in childhood, but throughout life, a trait only recently established by neuroscientists. Through decades of work treating patients with obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD), Schwartz made an extraordinary finding: while following the therapy he developed, his patients were effecting significant and lasting changes in their own neural pathways. It was a scientific first: by actively focusing their attention away from negative behaviors and toward more positive ones, Schwartz's patients were using their minds to reshape their brains–and discovering a thrilling new dimension to the concept of neuroplasticity. The Mind and the Brain follows Schwartz as he investigates this newly discovered power, which he calls self–directed neuroplasticity or, more simply, mental force. It describes his work with noted physicist Henry Stapp and connects the concept of 'mental force' with the ancient practice of mindfulness in Buddhist tradition. And it points to potential new applications that could transform the treatment of almost every variety of neurological dysfunction, from dyslexia to stroke–and could lead to new strategies to help us harness our mental powers. Yet as wondrous as these implications are, perhaps even more important is the philosophical dimension of Schwartz's work. For the existence of mental force offers convincing scientific evidence of human free will, and thus of man's inherent capacity for moral choice.","2009-08-04","http://books.google.es/books?id=5RlDm8d_2AsC&printsec=frontcover&dq=neuroplasticity%2Bbrain&hl=&cd=2&source=gbs_api","0061961981",

Your brain was thought to be “hardwired” to function in predetermined ways. It turns out that's not true. Your brain is not hardwired, it's ""softwired"" by experience. This book shows you how you can rewire parts of the brain to feel more positive about your life, remain calm during stressful times, and improve your social relationships. Written by a leader in the field of Brain-Based Therapy, it teaches you how to activate the parts of your brain that have been underactivated and calm down those areas that have been hyperactivated so that you feel positive about your life and remain calm during stressful times. You will also learn to improve your memory, boost your mood, have better relationships, and get a good night sleep.

"Hormones and Brain Plasticity","neuroplasticity+brain","[Luis Miguel Garcia-Segura Cellular and Molecular Neuroendocrinology Laboratory Cajal Institute]","[Medical]","The nervous system has a remarkable capacity for self-reorganization, and in this first systematic analysis of the interaction between hormones and brain plasticity, Luis Miguel Garcia-Segura proposes that hormones modulate metaplasticity in the brain. He covers a wide variety of hormones, brain regions, and neuroplastic events, and also provides a new theoretical background with which to interpret the interaction of hormones and brain remodeling throughout the entire life of the organism. Garcia-Segura argues that hormones are indispensable for adequately adapting the endogenous neuroplastic activity of the brain to the incessant modifications in external and internal environments. Their regulation of neuroplastic events in a given moment predetermines new neuroplastic responses that will occur in the future, adapting brain reorganization to changing physiological and behavioral demands throughout the life of the organism. The cross-regulation of brain plasticity and hormones integrates information originated in multiple endocrine glands and body organs with information coming from the external world in conjunction with the previous history of the organism. Multiple hormonal signals act in concert to regulate the generation of morphological and functional changes in neural cells, as well as the replacement of neurons, glial, and endothelial cells in neural networks. Brain remodeling, in turn, is involved in controlling the activity of the endocrine glands and regulating hormonal secretions. This bidirectional adjustment of brain plasticity in response to hormonal inputs, and adjustment of hormonal concentrations in response to neuroplastic events are crucial for maintaining the stability of the inner milieu and for the generation of adequate behavioral responses in anticipation of--and in adaptation to--new social and environmental circumstances and life events, including pathological conditions.","2009-04-05","http://books.google.es/books?id=MRtxkoAUp9MC&printsec=frontcover&dq=neuroplasticity%2Bbrain&hl=&cd=14&source=gbs_api","9780199716821",
"Brain Repair","neuroplasticity+brain","[Donald G. Stein]","[Medical]","Sixty years ago, the Nobel laureate Santiago Ramon y Cajal stated that ""in the adult brain, nervous pathways are fixed and immutable; everything may die, nothing may be regenerated."" Cajal's influence has been legendary--and conventional wisdom still holds that the human brain cannot repair itself. Today, however, remarkable discoveries from laboratories around the world offer a much more optimistic prognosis. In Brain Repair, three internationally renowned neuroscientists team up to offer an intriguing and up-to-the-minute introduction to the explosive advances being made in the research, technology, and treatment of brain damage. The key to neuroscience's most exciting discoveries to date is a theory that is rapidly gaining adherents in the scientific community--the theory of neuroplasticity. Unlike the prevalent notion that mental processes--like seeing, remembering, and speaking--take place only within highly specialized brain regions made up of irreplaceable and non-regenerating cells, neuroplasticity stresses that cells throughout the brain can not only regenerate, but can adapt their function to assume critical roles once performed by damaged tissue. In clear, accessible language, the authors show us that the brain manufactures a host of complex chemicals that actually foster growth in damaged brain cells. We visit the laboratories where researchers are untangling the mystery of Parkinson's disease and trying to understand what goes wrong in stroke victims, and why some, thought permanently impaired, show remarkable improvements. In addition, they discuss how even today misguided ideas can adversely affect how physicians treat patients--for example, they describe common drug treatments given to stroke and head trauma patients that can actually worsen the effects of brain damage. And, along the way, they detail the fascinating history of how brain structure and functioning has been understood and studied, from prehistoric times to the present. Over a half million people each year suffer brain-damaging injuries and diseases--but the outlook for their eventual recovery is far more hopeful than it was just a short while ago. A best-selling volume in France and Mexico, Brain Repair provides a vividly written, wide-ranging look at the leading edge of one of science's most exciting frontiers.","1997","http://books.google.es/books?id=zggEDDfk__MC&printsec=frontcover&dq=neuroplasticity%2Bbrain&hl=&cd=15&source=gbs_api","0195119185",

"Train Your Mind, Change Your Brain. How a New Science Reveals Our Extraordinary Potential to Transform Ourselves","neuroplasticity+brain","[Sharon Begley]","[Psychology]","Is it really possible to change the structure and function of the brain, and in so doing alter how we think and feel? The answer is a resounding yes. In late 2004, leading Western scientists joined the Dalai Lama at his home in Dharamsala, India, to address this very question–and in the process brought about a revolution in our understanding of the human mind. In this fascinating and far-reaching book, Wall Street Journal science writer Sharon Begley reports on how cutting-edge science and the ancient wisdom of Buddhism have come together to show how we all have the power to literally change our brains by changing our minds. These findings hold exciting implications for personal transformation. For decades, the conventional wisdom of neuroscience held that the hardware of the brain is fixed and immutable–that we are stuck with what we were born with. As Begley shows, however, recent pioneering experiments in neuroplasticity, a new science that investigates whether and how the brain can undergo wholesale change, reveal that the brain is capable not only of altering its structure but also of generating new neurons, even into old age. The brain can adapt, heal, renew itself after trauma, and compensate for disability. Begley documents how this fundamental paradigm shift is transforming both our understanding of the human mind and our approach to deep-seated emotional, cognitive, and behavioral problems. These breakthroughs show that it is possible to reset our happiness meter, regain the use of limbs disabled by stroke, train the mind to break cycles of depression and OCD, and reverse age-related changes in the brain. They also suggest that it is possible to teach and learn compassion, a key step in the Dalai Lama’s quest for a more peaceful world. But as we learn from studies performed on Buddhist monks, an important component in changing the brain is to tap the power of mind and, in particular, focused attention. This is the classic Buddhist practice of mindfulness, a technique that has become popular in the West and that is immediately available to everyone. With her extraordinary gift for making science accessible, meaningful, and compelling, Sharon Begley illuminates a profound shift in our understanding of how the brain and the mind interact. This tremendously hopeful book takes us to the leading edge of a revolution in what it means to be human.

How Drug and Alcohol Addiction Hijacks Our Brains The Science Behind Twelve-Step Recovery","neuroplasticity+brain","[Louis Teresi, MD]","[Self-Help]","Hijacking the Brain provides the first-ever scientific explanation for the success of Twelve-Step programs. Hijacking the Brain examines data provided by recent rapid growth in the fields of neuroscience, neuroimaging, psychology, sociobiology and interpersonal neurobiology that have given us new, dramatic insights into the neural and hormonal correlates of stress and addiction, cognitive decline with addiction, as well as for the relative success of Twelve-Step Programs of recovery. Addiction is recognized by experts as an organic brain disease, and most experts promote Twelve-Step programs (AA, NA, CA, etc.) which invoke a 'spiritual solution' for recovery. To date, no one has described why these programs work. 'Hijack' tells us why. In 'Hijack, ' the role of 'working The Steps' for reducing stress and becoming emotionally centered is discussed in depth. A full chapter is devoted to the rewarding and comforting physiology of meditation and the spiritual experience. The author uses examples from animal sociobiology, as well as sophisticated human brain-imaging studies, to demonstrate that empathic socialization and altruism are instinctive and 'naturally rewarding' and, along with Step Work, act as a substitute for the 'synthetic rewards' of drugs of abuse. 'Hijack' does not challenge the Steps or the Traditions of Twelve-Step programs. The sole intention of Hijacking the Brain is to 'connect the dots' between an 'organic brain disease' and a 'spiritual solution' with sound physical, scientific evidence. Avoiding strict scientific language as much as possible, 'Hijack' is written for the layperson and abundantly illustrated.","2011-10-20","http://books.google.es/books?id=C28JEj-KgAcC&pg=PA171&dq=neuroplasticity%2Bbrain&hl=&cd=22&source=gbs_api","1463444850",

Think of the new vocabulary: Global brain, collective intelligence, global village, and cyberspace. That should tell us something about the neural rewiring that is taking place inside of our brains, whether or not we are aware of it. The fact that the human brain changes throughout a person's life in response to intellectual stimulation, physical exercise, exposure to new cultural environments, learning opportunities, and challenges is a revolutionary discovery. Till twenty years ago neuroscientists believed in the conventional theory that the brain's ability at making new neural connections stopped before a child entered adolescence. That is the old dogma. There is a ""Second Copernican Revolution"" taking place inside of our brains, writes the author, quoting Carl Zimmer. Some experts are suggesting that we are already living in what Richard Restack calls the ""neurosociety."" Ray Kurzweil, the futurist, is predicting that by 2045 A.D., human beings will be living in an era of ""singularity,"" when non biological machines invented by human brains and human ingenuity are going to outsmart human intelligence billions of times. What is going to be the fate of the human spirit, human spirituality, the feeling of connection to a force and power that is greater than us (God), our ability to use spiritual imagination and our intelligence?

The first person to use the term neural plasticity appears to have been the Polish neuroscientist Jerzy Konorski.","2010-05-19","http://books.google.es/books?id=8atVQwAACAAJ&dq=neuroplasticity%2Bbrain&hl=&cd=24&source=gbs_api","6130316119",
"Assessing Mindfulness & Acceptance Processes in Clients. Illuminating the Theory & Practice of Change","neuroplasticity+brain","[Ruth A. Baer]","[Psychology]","Thousands of therapists use mindfulness-based treatments in their practices and have witnessed firsthand the effectiveness of these approaches on clients suffering from anxiety, depression, and other common mental health issues. But in order to fully understand the role of mindfulness and acceptance processes, it is vital that practitioners develop a comprehensive understanding of how these processes function in the brain and how a client's mindfulness, acceptance, self-compassion, spirituality, and focus on values can accurately be measured. In Assessing Mindfulness and Acceptance Processes in Clients, contributors including Kelly Wilson evaluate and discuss the current methods for measuring processes of change in clients. Readers will assess the variables that represent potential processes of change, such as mindfulness and acceptance, and determine the importance of each of these processes to enhanced psychological functioning, well-being, and quality of life. This seminal contribution to the existing professional literature on mindfulness-based treatments will be of interest to clinicians, students, and researchers interested in learning more about the function of mindfulness and acceptance-based therapeutic approaches.","2010","http://books.google.es/books?id=8K41STQ06MMC&pg=PA185&dq=neuroplasticity%2Bbrain&hl=&cd=25&source=gbs_api","1572246944",

Herman Professor of Psychiatry University of Cincinnati, Elizabeth Young Professor of Psychiatry University of Michigan]","[Medical]","Sex is a fundamentally important biological variable. Recent years have seen significant progress in the integration of sex in many aspects of basic and clinical research, including analyses of sex differences in brain function. Significant advances in the technology available for studying the endocrine and nervous systems are now coupled with a more sophisticated awareness of the interconnections of these two communication systems of the body. A thorough understanding of the current knowledge, conceptual approaches, methodological capabilities, and challenges is a prerequisite to continued progress in research and therapeutics in this interdisciplinary area. Sex Differences in the Brain provides scientists with the basic tools for investigating sex differences in brain and behavior and insight into areas where important progress in understanding physiologically relevant sex differences has already been made. This book was edited and co-authored by members of the Isis Fund Network on Sex, Gender, Drugs and the Brain, sponsored by the Society for Womens Health Research. The book is arranged in three parts. The first part of the book introduces the study of sex differences in the brain, with an overview of how the brain, stress systems, and pharmacogenetics differ in males and females and how this information is important for the study of behavior and neurobiology of both genders. The second part presents examples of sex differences in neurobiology and behavior from both basic and clinical research perspectives, covering both humans and nonhuman animals. The final part discusses sex differences in the neurobiology of disease and neurological disorders. For interested individuals as well as those who are considering conducting research at the intersections of endocrinology, neuroscience, and other areas of biomedicine, the study of sex differences offers exciting and challenging questions and perspectives. This book is intended as a guide and resource for clinicians, scientists, and students.","2007-10-31","http://books.google.es/books?id=IeaLXPWsbuAC&pg=PA201&dq=neuroplasticity%2Bbrain&hl=&cd=26&source=gbs_api","9780198042556",
"Brain Protection in Schizophrenia, Mood and Cognitive Disorders","neuroplasticity+brain","[Michael S. Ritsner]","[Medical]","Neuroprotection is a novel perspective for the treatment of disorders that lead to neurodegeneration and disabilities as a result of deterioration of neurons due to apoptosis, oxidative stress, excitotoxicity, and other mechanisms. These mechanisms have implications not only for neurodegenerative disorders, but also for schizophrenia, mood and cognitive disorders. The purpose of this book is to provide an up-to-date overview of basic and clinical studies concerning the neuroprotective approach, mechanisms, and several compounds with neuroprotective properties that may contribute to more efficacious treatment of major mental health disorders. The book is divided into two sections. The first section serves as an introduction and overview of conceptual issues of the neuroprotective approach, and some neurobiological advances. Chapters in this section review definitions, perspectives, and issues that provide a conceptual base for the rest of the book. In addition, this part includes chapters in which the authors present and discuss the findings from basic studies of neurodegenerative mechanisms that are associated with the pathogenesis of major mental health disorders. The second section focuses on findings obtained from clinical trials with neuroprotective compounds, and neuromodulatory techniques. The take-home message is that principles of the neuroprotective approach may be applied to treatment of schizophrenia, mood and cognitive disorders. Contributors to this book are among the most active investigators and clinicians in the field who provide new perspectives not only clarifying ongoing controversies but also propose diverse aspects and new insights to neuroprotection. This book is intended for a broad readership, which includes a broad spectrum of readers including neuroscientists, psychiatrists, neurologists, pharmacologists, clinical psychologists, general practitioners, geriatricians, graduate students, and policy makers in the fields of mental health.","2010-06-16","http://books.google.es/books?id=KcB8lFjoQHkC&pg=PA38&dq=neuroplasticity%2Bbrain&hl=&cd=27&source=gbs_api","9789048185535",

"Heal Your Brain. How the New Neuropsychiatry Can Help You Go from Better to Well","neuroplasticity+brain","[David J. Hellerstein]","[Self-Help]","Maybe you are one of the more than 45 million people in the United States who is currently struggling with depression. Maybe anxiety keeps you from truly enjoying your job, your relationships, your life. Maybe every change you have tried to make seems to have failed and you are beginning to feel as if change is simply not possible. Author David J. Hellerstein uses the term New Neuropsychiatry to refer to a dramatically different approach to help people who have depression and anxiety disorders. Unlike Old Psychiatry, which often focused on early life issues, the New Neuropsychiatry focuses on improving present-day life and on achieving long-term remission of symptoms. Heal Your Brain combines the advances of neuroscience and medicine with the art of the storyteller to show how the New Neuropsychiatry can alter the course of your life. Dr. Hellerstein, a psychiatrist at Columbia University’s College of Physicians and Surgeons, puts this new form of psychiatry to the test. Depression and anxiety disorders damage the brain, but as Dr. Hellerstein explains, the right treatment can change the patterns of brain activity, brain cell connections, and even the brain’s anatomy. To illustrate, he relates the stories of people as they travel through various phases of New Neuropsychiatry treatment, from evaluation to therapy to remission, and illustrates how this approach can help you progress through each phase as well. The book’s compelling narrative demonstrates that, in many cases, it is possible to achieve a stable recovery and return to—or even experience for the first time—a life free of crippling anxiety and depression.","2011-05-01","http://books.google.es/books?id=7o-fiexnnZQC&pg=PA140&dq=neuroplasticity%2Bbrain&hl=&cd=37&source=gbs_api","9780801899324",
